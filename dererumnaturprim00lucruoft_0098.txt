64 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

MSS. reading: for (1) the vine-plant puts forth in spring, not in
autumn3 (α) it is easy to account for uites as a gloss of uuas.

fundi cannot be explained as :fetusfimdere (l. 351).

176. suo tempore, ‘at the proper time.’

178. tempestates, ὧραι, ‘the seasons.¹

adsunt =fauent.

uiuida, ‘quickened ' by the favourable weather.

¹79· teneras, ‘young’

180. flerent: the subject to be supplied is ‘plants.’

subito, ‘ unexpectedly.'

exorerentur: the ordinary form, exorirentur, is forbidden by the
metre.

181. spatio, ‘time': again l. 184.

182. quippe ubi, ‘since in that case.’ forent: conditional subj.

genitali concillo, ‘from meeting to make’ a plant: concilium,
σύγκρισις, is the technical expression for the union of atoms to make
a res, and discidium sor the breaking up of such a union-

¹83· tempore iniquo, ‘by the unfavourable season’: the abl. is
not temporal.

184. porro, ‘thirdly.' ususzopus.

185. seminis ad coitum, ‘for the coming together of (supple-
mentary) atoms.’ Growth os animals or plants is due to the accretion
of appropriate atoms.

Lucr. used semen above (1. 160) for the atoms out of which things
are originally made: here he uses it sor the atoms by which they
grow: in his view nasci and crescere were both parts of a single
process.

186. ‘For little children would grow to full size in a moment':
such things may happen in Wonderland but not in real life.

Note that' the sense of subito differs from that in 1. 180.

187. arbusta are not ‘bushes,' for that would weaken the argument,
but ‘forest trees’; the proper word, arbores, is rejected by the
mette: see n. to l. 3 5²· The verb, salirent, by itself suggests height.

188. quando, ‘since’

189. tempore: Munro printed this for semine of MSS„ and inserted
the l. which follows: similar endings account sor the loss of a line.

Lucr. is repeating the two points already stated, i.e. that all things
grow from a fixed seed at a fixed season.
