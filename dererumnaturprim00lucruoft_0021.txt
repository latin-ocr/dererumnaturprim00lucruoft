INTRODUCTION xiii

whom he rather suspects ot intending, some day, to play
truant. A modern writer has called Lucretius 'the
aristocrat with a mission'²; and it is true that his tone
is that of a man living in easy circumstances and familiar
with the luxury which he condemns as not productive of
happiness,

It is even more certain that he took no part in public

other men: the literature he loved belonged to the past.
He was before all things a student. Much of his time must
have been spent over the Greek philosophers and poets.
In one of his very rare sels-revelations he tells us that the

philosophers whose authority he acknowledges or whose
doctrine he refutes; Empedocles and Democritus are
conspicuous among the former, Heracleitus and Anaxa-
goras among the latter. He also translates from or imitates
the following Greek authors: Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus,
Euripides, Thucydides, Hippocrates, and perhaps Aristo-
phanes and Plato. His Greek library must have been
