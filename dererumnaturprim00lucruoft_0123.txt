N OTES 89

503—550. These aloms are solid. For (1) body and void each exist
per se: where one is, tlte other is not ,· therefore tlte oloms, being pure
body, are without void. (2) 7 'he fact that created things contain void
shows that tlze substance which contains this void, z's itself without
void. Jhese atoms are also eternal. For (1) it is only the presence of
void in α thing, which makes z't liable to be broken up ‚· and therefore
the atoms, because they contain no void, cannot be broken up. And
(2), if tlte atoms were nol elernal, all things would have been reduced
to nothing, and tlte visible world would leave been produced out of
nothing.

Lucr. first gives two proofs that his atoms are solida (ll. 503-519)‚
and then two prooss that they are aeterna (ll. 520-547), and sums
up in conclusion (ll. 548-550). But the course of the argument is
not kept clear, as will be shown below. Many alterations, by
transposition or rejection of verses, have been proposed; but none
clears up the difficulties. This paragraph, and the whole passage down
to l. 634, must have been lest by the author in an unfinished state.

503. natura. duarum rerum=duae res: these are the two ‘sub-
stances‚‘ body and void.

504. longe goes with dissimilis.

505. Where Luer. is insisting on the absolute distinction between
body and void, he ought clearly to call the latter inane, and not
locus, res in quo quaeque geruntm·; but he has inappropriately
retained this phrase from l. 482. See n. before l. 329.

506. sibi per se, αὐτὴν καθ’ αὑτήν, ‘sor and by itsels’ : a stronger
form osper se: again iii 684.

Is each os the substances excludes the other, then an atom, which
is corpus, can contain no void.

508. ea: ibi.

tenet. se, ‘maintains itself,' i.e. ‘is.’

510. ac here is our i.e.

511. praeterea ε second] y.

This second argument deals with atoms in concilio, i.e. when
they have combined to form a res, here called res genita, ‘a thing
produced* out of moms, with an admixture os void.

5¹2· materiem, ‘atoms.'

circum: adverb.

constare = esse.
