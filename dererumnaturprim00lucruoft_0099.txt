NOTES 65

Editors who deny a lacuna here have to account sor the solecism
os crescentes agreeing with onmia: no similar instance, without
metrical necessity, can be produced srom the poem.

¹9¹· sua. de materia, ‘out of the atoms suited to it.'

19²· huc accedit, uti, lit. ‘to this is added, that...‚‘ i.e. ‘besides,'
‘fourthly.’

certis imbribus anni, ‘ fixed seasons sor rain)

¹93· submittere: cp. l. 8.

¹94· secreta. cibo = priuata cibo os l. 1038.

natura animantum is exactly the sanie as animalia: see 11. to
l. 4¹9-

196-198. The argument, too briefly stated by Lucr., is this: plants
find their sood in rain, and animals find their sood in plants: hence
we see that there are atoms common to rain and plants‚ and also
atoms common to planis and animals, though the three products are
quite distinct. An illustration is afforded by the letters of the
alphabet: two words may denote very different things and yet have
many letters in common. Lucr. loves this illustration: he felt that
letters are to words very much what atorns are to res: see ll. 823-827,
ii 688-694.

It seems that these three lines were hastily inserted here, when
Lucr. was writing ll. 803-816: they are hardly intelligible, without
the explanation given in the later passage. See n. at l. 146.

196. corpora, i.e. prima corpora, ‘atoms’2 cf. l. 215.

rebus, ‘to created things.y

198. principiis: abl. osprimordz'a: see n. to l. 55.

199-204. The giants we read of in the old poets never existed:
and that is because the atoms which make a man cannot combine
to form a res above a certain size; the atoms which make an elephant
or a giraffe are different, or combine differently, and can sorm some-
thing much bigger.

¹99· denique=f1fthly.

200. pedibus, ‘on soot.’

per uada...tra.nsire‚ ‘to sord.'

τοι. Lucr. is thinking of the Homeric Cyclops: ef. Od. ix 481
ἧκε δ’ ἀπορρήξας κορυφὴν ὄρεος μεγάλοιο.

202. uiuendo uincere, ‘to outlive!

saecla: see n. to 1. 20.
