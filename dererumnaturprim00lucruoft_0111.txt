N OTES 77

corpora: to Lucr. sound and cold are corpora.

quaeque, ‘in each case!

358. denique: thirdiy.

359. nilo: abl. of amount os differenee.

figura: abl. of descriptionzfigura and filum are both used by
Lucr. to represent ὄγκος, ‘size’z magyu'ludo is excluded by the metre.

361. corporis, governed by tantundem, is delayed to the relative
clause: see n. tol. 16.

plumbo, ‘a lump of lead’ of equal size.

pendere: supply as subject lanae glomus.

362. deorsum scans as a spondee.

363. natura. mame: inane: see n. to l. 419.

manet, ‘always is.’

364. quod: transl. ‘when a thing....·

uldetur‚ ‘is shown to be.’

365. declarat, ‘it makes plain.'

366. grauius, ‘the heavier tl1ing‚‘ i.e. the lead.

367. dedicat, ‘tells us': cf. l. 422.

368. est, ‘exists.'

ratione: see n. to 1. 342-
369. admixtum rebus, ‘interspersed throughout creation’: cf.

ll. 382, 655, and also 1. 660. Here, as in l. 330, Lucr. is speaking
of void gene1·ally; when he refers to void inside things, he makes
this clear by inserting in, e.g. ll. 511, 569.

370-397. Some deny tlte existence of void and explain motion as
due to a different cause .· tlzey say tlzat motion z's a mere exchange qf
place between two oly'ects. Bul neither of two objects, e. g. a fislz and
water, could begin to move, if there were no void. Again, is two flat
bodies part sudlenly after contact, llze space left between them is filled
witlz air by a gradual process and nol z'nstantly. Nor can tlzez'r
mwing aparl be explained by contraction qf tlte air oulsz'de them.
And indeed suclz contraction of air cannot take place without she
existence of void.

370. fflud in his rebus: cf. l. 80: illud is governed by prae-
currere, ‘to anticipate.'

371. fingunt, ‘falsely teach.'

372· squamigeris: piscibus: so Luer. uses lanigerae for oues and
pennipotentes sor aues.
