122 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

regio is lit. ‘a ruling': hence e regione, ‘in accordance with a
ruling‚' = ‘in a straight line.'

959. extremum=dt<pov of Epicurus: the end or outside of any·
thing limited.

debebat, ‘it ought‚’ isit were limited.

961. quod finiat, ‘something to bound it)

iat—sequatur, ‘so that that thing is seen, further than which our
sense does not follow' (the thing bounded): e-g. we cease to see the
ocean, as soon as we begin to see the shore: therefore the ocean is
bounded by the shore.

This represents παρ’ ἕτερόν τι θεωρεῖται of Epicurus.

962. haec sensus natura. = hic sensus.

963. nunc, ‘in fact’: cf. 1. 110.

fatendum: sc. est.

965. refert: cf. 1. 908.

966. usque adeo, ‘so invariahly.’

967. relinquit: the subject is probably quz‘sque, not locus.

968. praeterea = secondly.

si iam: see n. to 1. 396.

969. omne quod est spatium=0mne, the universe: this is
proved by l. 975.

The phrase occurred in l. 523: it denotes the whole of space,
including all atoms and res formed of atoms, which are included in
space. 1t must be remembered that in the Epicurean conception of
the universe empty space predominates immensely over space
occupied by body. Giussani gives this illustration: ‘if we think of
the volume of water in the Ocean‚ we think of it as continuom,
without regard to the fish that live in it, though we admit, on
reflexion, that in the precise point where any fish is, there is no
water.’

970. telum: Bentley first pointed out that Lucr. is thinking of
the ancient method of declaring war, by which the fetialis threw a
spear from the Roman territory into the hostile country: the
ceremony is described in Livy i 32, η.

97²· longe, ‘to a distance.'

974. sumas, ‘accept.’

977. probeat ιε a contracted form of prohibeat (cf. iii 864), like
debere and praebere from dehz‘bere and praehibere-
