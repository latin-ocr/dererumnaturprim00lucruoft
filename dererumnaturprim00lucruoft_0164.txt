130 DE RERVM NATVRA‚ LIBER PRIMVS

1077. quisquam is osten used as an adj. by Lucr.; and ulli below
is used as a noun.

1078. ponderis ui=their weight.

1079. antem, ‘also’ t so used chiefly in negative sentences.

subsistere, ‘to support.’

¹080. quin...pergat, ‘without proceeding,‘ i.e. ‘but must pro-
ceed....'

quod, ⁸ as.'

1082. cuppedine uictae is ironical.

1083-1093. lee Stoic theory is not only false hut inconsistent also:
only two of the fhur elements are supposed to press towards tlze centroe
tlzc other two are said toflyfrom it.

1084. Sed, ‘but only.’

Munro supposed that a verse is lost here of this kind—et quae de
supero in terram mittuntur ut imbres; and this gives good sense.
But Giussani asks, what is the use of this distinction, and why is
water described at such disproportionate length, and what is the
meaning of quasi. He himself transposes ll. 1085, 1086, and
translates thus—⁸ things which are comprised, so to speak, in the
terrestrial element,' i.e. metals‚ plants, animals etc. His view seems
to gain support from Seneca Nat. Quaest. ii 1, 2 tertia pars deaquis,
terr-ts, arbustis, satis (crops) quaerit, et, ut iurisconsultorum uerbo
utar, dc omnibus quae solo continentur.

1087. tenuis...auras, ‘the subtle clement of air.’

1088. simul, ⁸ likewise.’

1089. sig-ms: cf. 1. α.

1090. pasci: see n. to 1. ⁴23¹·

1092, 1093. Two puzzling lines, whose connexion with the subject
would be clearer, if the text were complete. The upward growth of
plants is again referred to in ii 189 sursum nitidae fruges arbustaque
crescunt, Ι pondera (=corpora). quantum in sc est, cum (though)
deorsum cuncta ferantur.

Perhaps the Stoics explained the upward growth of trees as the
result of internal heat: this was the explanation given by Empedocles.

1094-1101. Of the conclusion at least of the lost verses there ean
be no doubtz Lucr. must have repeated here that the number of

atoms is infinite, οι- else the destruction os the world would take
place immediately.
