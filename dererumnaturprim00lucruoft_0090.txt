56 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

1 ¹4· et by itself is here misleading; therefore transl. ‘and they do
not know.’ There follow three theorias, not os the soul’s origin but

of what happens to the soul at bodily death.

nobiscum: with the body.
(inempta, ‘broken up' into its component atoms. This is the

theory of Epicurus and Lucr., that the soul, being dissolved into
atoms, ceases to exist.
115. The second theory is the popular belief that the soul goes

down to Hades.

uisat= adeat.
uastasque lacunas, ‘desolate caverns’: uastus here implies, not

size but absence of lise and joy. lacunae are ‘hollows,’ which may or
may not be full of water: in Hades they are not.

116. The third theory is metempsychosis, or transmigration ofthe
soul, held notably by Pythagoras.

pecudes alias, ‘lower animals': pecudes is governed by the in of
insinuet.

diuinitus = diuino numine of I. 154.

117-126 is a parenthesis: perhaps the chief motive for inserting
it was that Lucr. might pay a tribute to Ennius who invented the
Latin hexameter and prepared the way for the nobler verse of
Lucr.

117. ut cet. refers only to the third theory.

Ennius noster, ‘ Roman Ennius’: for the same epithet, cf. Cic.
Pro Arclc. 22.

At the beginning of his great poem, the Annales, Ennius told
how, when he was sleeping on Mount Helicon, the ghost of Homer
appeared and revealed to him that the soul of Homer had passed
into a peacock and next into the body os Ennius: cf. Pers. 6, ιο
cor iubet hoc Enni, postquam destertuit esse Ι Μιεοηιίἰες, Quintus
panone ex Pythagoreo (after he ceased to be Homer in his dream,
plain Quintus after being a Pythagorean peacock).

118. Helicone: the hill of the Muses, with an allusion to his
dream while sleeping there.

perenni fronde coronam: the evergreen bay, representing im-
mortal same.

119. Italas belongs in sense rather to hominum than gentis: cf.

l· 474·
