xiv IN TRODUCTION

large ; and one is tempted to find a special affinity between
his mind and that of Thucydides. The Latin· writers
whom he seems to have loved best survive only in frag—
ments2 yet it is possible to trace imitation of Ennius and
his nephew Pacuvius, the chief epic poet and the chief
tragedian of primitive Roman literature.

Finally, from the truth and evident pleasure with
which he describes natural scenes and objects of all kinds,
and uses them to illustrate his argument, we may surely
infer that his life was spent by preference in the country
and in the open air. One great charm of his poem is that
it breathes more of the open air than of the libraryl. Let
us think of Lucretius in some quiet place away from the
bloody faction·fights of the Roman streets ; let us imagine
him watching the lambs frisking over the meadows in
spring, or the summer sunrise, or the sea now dashing
on the rocks and now rippling over the sancl; let us fancy
him returning at nightfall to pore over the rolls of Epi-
curus, and ponder the hard problem of reproducing their
contents in the stubborn medium of Latin hexameter
verse. How many a rough draft he must have thrown
into the fire in the small hours! And then he went to bed,
to pursue the familiar task in his dreams.

DE RERUM NATURA

The De Rerum Natura is a didactie poem: it professes
to expound systematically a particular subject. The ·
Works and Days of Hesiod, the Georgics of Virgil, Pope¹s
Essay on Man, all belong to this class of poetry. The
subject which the poem of Lucretius 15 intended to explain
is the philosophical system of Epicurus or rather a part
of it. The system was divided‚ like other ancient systems,
into three parts: (1 ) Physics, or Natural Science; (2) Ethics;
