INTRODUCTION xv

(3) Logic or, as Epicurus preferred to call it, Canonic, the
method of ascertaining truth. lt is the first of these parts
with which Lucretius is mainly concerned ; his references
to Ethics or Logic are merely incidental.

Poetry had been used already by Greek philosophers
to eonvey their doctrine, for example, by Parmenides
and Xenophanes ; but the form and title of this poem are
derived especially from Empedocles of Agrigentum, who
lived in the fifth century B.c. and wrote a treatise Περὶ
Φύσεως in hexameter verse, of which considerable frag-
ments are extant. The poem of Lucretius is dedicated
to Gaius Memmius, an aristocrat and politician¹; why
Lucretius chose him out for this distinction we do not
know. No other contemporary is mentioned throughout
the poem.

The first two books are devoted to an account of
atoms and void, which are, according to Epicurus, the
eternal and exclusive elenlents of which the universe is
composed; here, too, the rival theories of other philo-
sophers, Heracleitus, Empedocles, and Anaxagoras, are
stated and refuted. The third book is taken up in proving
that the soul is not immortal but a material part of man,
made up of atoms as the body is, and perishing with the
body. The fourth book explains the Epicurean theory
of sight and the other senses; the fifth discusses the
motions of the heavenly bodies, and describes the origin
of the world, of lise, and of human society. The last book
is miscellaneous in its contents: it begins by discussing
the nature of thunder, lightning, and other celestial
phenomena; it deals next with various natural curiosities,
such as magnetic attraction, and ends with a description,
taken from Thucydides, of the plague which devastated
Athens in 430 B.c. There is no sort of epilogue to the
poem as a whole; it is very likely, that if Lucretius had
lived to complete his task, the ending would have been

less abrupt than it is now.
