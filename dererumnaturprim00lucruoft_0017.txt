Τ. LUCRETIUS CARUS

The poem of Lucretius is a notable instance of what
Milton in his Areopagitica calls ‘ the precious life-blood of
a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose
to a life beyond life'; but of the poet's own life and its
outward circumstances hardly anything at all is known.
We are not told where he was born, or where he lived, or
in what society he moved ; we can only guess at the way
in which his life was spent. The tradition confines itself
almost exclusively to his death.

The Chronicle of Jerome, compiled about 400 A.D., has
a record, probably derived from a lost work by Suetonius,
to the following effect:

The poet Titus Lucretius was born in 94 13.c.; he lost his
reason in consequence of drinking a love-philtre and died by
his own hand in his forty-fourth year, after composxng in his
lucid intervals several books which Cicero afterwards cor-
rectedl.

Thus the date os his death would be 5013.c. But
Donatus, in his life of Virgil, mentions as a remarkable
coincidence that Lucretius died (nothing is said of mad-
ness or suicide) on the very day on which Virgil entered
on his sixteenth year2, i.e. on October 15, 55 13.c. It is
generally believed that Donatus has preserved the true

¹ Titus Lucretius poeta nascitur. Postea amatorio poculo in
furorem uersus, cum aliquot libros per interualla insaniae con-
scribsisset, quos postea Cicero emendauit, propria se manu inter-
fecit anno aetatis xmv.

² [Vergilius] uirilem togam xv anno natali suo accepit,
euenitque ut eo ipso die Lucretius poeta decederet. Donatus also
probably took this biography from Suetonius.
