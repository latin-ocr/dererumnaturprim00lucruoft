60 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

¹40· uirtus, ‘worth' τ perhaps imagined by Lucr.: see n. to l. 26.

sperata (=quam spero) is nearly the same as ‘suture.’

¹41· suauis may be either gen. or nom.

amicitiae: prob. governed by uoluptas ; some make it gen. after
laborem.

Epicurus attached great importance to sriendship as productive of
pleasure.

sufferre: MSS. have efferre: but, as Luer. twice elsewhere has
sufferre laborem (iii 999, v 1272), it seems likely that the s of
quemuis caused the first letter of the verb to drop out.

¹42· noctes: direct acc. after uigilare: cf. Ovid Her. 12, 169
noctes uzgilantur amarae.

uigilare, ‘to watch‚' i.e. to give the time sor sleep to study:
lucubrare is to cut off sleep at the other end for the same purpose.
Even in his sleep, the dreams of Lucr. turned on the master
passion: cf. iv 962 soll. (most men dream of the subject which
absorbs their waking thoughts, lawyers of the courts, sailors of the
sea) nos (Ι) agere hoc autem et naturam quaerere rerum Ι semper et
inuentam patriis exponere chartis.

serenas adds poetry to the picture: the word means ‘cloudless,’
not ‘windless.'

¹43· ‘Seeking for language and for verse, by which Ι may in the
end be able...': demum shows that the task is long and hard, and
also emphasises again the old point, that the metrical difficulty is the
most sormidable.

¹45· penitus ean mean either ‘deeply ’ or ‘thoroughly,' and so
might qualisy either occultas or conuisere. For the former, cf. Ad
Herenn. iv 9 flantis maximos penitus absconditos; Cic. D.N. D. i 49
res occultas et penitus abditas. For penitus conuiserc, cf. Cic. De Or.
ii 99, Brutus 306.

But it is certain that Lucr. used res occultae without an adverb to
denote the invisible atomic world: cf. 1. 424. It is therefore better
to take penitus with conuisere.

146—158. The remedy for this sear is the study qs philosophy. The
first axiom of our system is this: Nothing z's produced from nothing.
lt is from ignorame that men attribute to supernatural causes what-

ever they cannot understand in nature. Grasping this principle, we
can dispense with supernatural agencies.
