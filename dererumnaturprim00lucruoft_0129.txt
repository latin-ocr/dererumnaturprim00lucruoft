NOTES 95

581. quonlam, ⁴ since’ on the hypothesis which Lucr. denies.

fragili = quac potest frangi, ‘divisible.’

constant. = sunt.

582. discrepat, μάχεται, ‘it is inconsistent' with the hypothesis
in question.

manere, ⁸ to continue to exist!

584-598. The regularity‚ with which birds of the same species
present the same markings, and the effu-pringi of all animals repeat
the habits qf their parents, is a proqf that the atoms. out qf which
each kind os creature is made, are anchangeable.

Proof is now given that atoms are unchangeable, immutabilia,
ἀμετάβλητα in the ianguage of Epicurus.

585. rehum ‘creatures’ here. Each kind grows to a certain size
and lives sor a certain period; and these 1aws, by which they and
all other created things are governed, were laid down (sancitum) by
Nature at the beginning and can never be broken.

586. foedera naturai: again ii 302, v 310: and the same laws
are calledfalifoedcra ii 254, and aeui leges (eternal laws) v 58.

587. exstat=est.

The ending of this l. is exceptionally harsh in rhythm.

588. quin—ut, ‘nay all things are invariable‚ to such a degree
tl1at...’: for constant, cf. 1. 165.

589. uariae, either ‘different,’ or ‘of different colours' (ποικίλαι).

111 ordine, ‘one aster another)

590. generalis, ‘common to their kind!

59¹· The apodosis begins here.

immutabffl’: this elision is rare except in the fifth foot of the
verse: but cf. 1. 978.

quoque goes with materiae (atoms).

592. debent: the subject is uolucres.

Thus variation os species is denied by Lucr.; yet he had a clear
notion of natural selection: cf. v 855—877.

594. quid possit-haerens: repeated from 1. 75 soll.

We now learn that the immutability of natural law is due to the
immutability of the atom.

597. saecla: see n. to 1. 20.

598. motus: e.g. all ducklings take to the water, but all chickens
run about on land.
