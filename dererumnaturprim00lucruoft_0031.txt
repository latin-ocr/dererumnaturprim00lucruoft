IN TRODUCTION xxiii

or parts of lines; his additions can be readily identified
owing to the great difference of his handwriting. These
correetors left many gross errors without alteration or
comment: thus in l. 1 of Book iii the true text is

E tenebris tantis tam clarum extollere lumen:

but O reads, with no sign of correction,
Ο tenebris tantis tam clarum extollere flmnenl.

The spelling of O is remarkably good, and our present
spelling of Latin has been influenced by it. Thus it
preserves the writing of est as an enclitic, which is vouched
for by the ancient grammarians: e.g. it has patefactast in
i 10, necessest in i 146, uisumst ini 308. Yet the scribe
betrays in many cases ignorance of the mette. For in-
stance, Lucretius uses the genitive in -ᾶῖ 114 times in
nouns and three times in adJectives: the scribe regularly
omits the last syllable and thus makes a line end with
such a word as materia or uici. Again Lucretius is proved
by metre to have used nil and mlo, never nihil or nihilffl
but the scribe always used the longer forms, so that i 160
ends nillil semine egeret.

In O (but not in Q) there are occasional headings,
each oceupying a line, and intended to serve as a kind
of table of contents. These are written in different and
larger letters. But occasionally the scribe has mistaken
a heading for a line of the poem, or a line of the poem for
a heading2.

That O is older than Q is proved by the fact, that in
Q four portioris of the text (i 738—785, ii 253—304,
ii 757-806‚ ν 928—979) appear, not in their right places
but together at the end of the poem. This shows that
after O was written, four passages had fallen out of their
right places in the MS. from which both O and Q were
copied, and were inserted at the end before Q was copied.
Now each of these passages consists of 52 lines, if the

¹ Q omits E but reads lumen. ² See note to 1. 334.
