46 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

amiczksimos, et acerrimos ciues, Domitium, Nzgridium, Memmium.
By acerrimus ciuis Cic. means exactly what Lucr. means by this
verse.

44-49 of the Mss. are omitted in the text. The lines are a quo·
tation from ii 646—651‚ where Lucr. translates the second of the
κύριαι δόξαι (Articles of Belief) of Epicurus, to the effect that the
gods have no dealings with men. In order to confute Lucr. out of
his own mouth, some ancient reader wrote these lines on his
margin ; from the margin they crept into the text of the original of
all our MSS.

It seems that the intruding verses ousted some others written by
Lucr. sor this place. For in 1. 43 he is addressing Venus; in l. 50
he is addressing Memmius, and no indication of the change is
given.

50-61. Lissen witlz atlantion lo me, wlzile I sel forth tlze true
philosophy. l have two subjects to explain .· (ι) heaven and the gods;
(2) tlte atoms out of wlzz'clz all things are made. (For these atoms l
shall use α variety of names.)

This paragraph is ill-placed. It is the regular custom of Lucr. to
place his praise of Epicurus before the statement of his subject-
matter; and it seerns especially unlikely in the first Book that he
should launch out into technicalities before making the general
attack on superstition which follows (62-101).

50. quod superestznext: a common formula of transition in
Lucr.‚ but not appropriate here unless some lines have been lost:
the phrase often begins an apoclosis.

animum sagacem, ‘a keen intellect’: a metaphor from the power
of scent in dogs: cf. l. 402. Milton writes ‘sagacious of his quarry’;
but in modern English ‘sagacious’ has lost this meaning and suits
an elephant better than a dog.

51. ueram ad rationem, ‘to the true system’ of philosophy, i.e.
that of Epicurus. ratio, very common in Lucr.‚ is used by him with
many meanings: for this meaning, cf. 1. 943, and iii ¹4 (to Epicurus)
ratio tua.

52. disposta: for the dropping out of i, see n. to 1. 35.

53. sint, having no emphasis, would not be placed at the end of
the clause by an Augustan poet.

contempta. relinquas, ‘you despise and leave untouched': the
