of 1850. The MSS. were sent to Berlin for his use in
April, 1846, and here at last was the man who could use
them: he had all the needful qualifications—profound
knowledge, diligence, and genius. He set the text of
Lucretius once for all on a scientific basis, and in the
next year he died. His work has been supplemented and
corrected by Munro and others; but he remains and will
remain the greatest editor of Lucretius.

One of these MSS. is a folio, the other a quarto. Hence
they were called by Lachmann Oblongus and Quadratus:
and the signs O and Q are used to designate the MSS. and
their respective readings, and have been so used in the
few critical notes subjoined to the text here printed.

The Codex Vossianus Oblongus, otherwise O, is older
and better than Q: it is indeed one of the first of all
Latin MSS. and deserves to rank with much earlier MSS.
written in capitals, such as the Ambrosian of Plautus, the
Bembine of Terence, and the Mediceus and Vaticani of
virgil. A photographic faesimile was published at Leyden
in 1908, with a preface by the veteran palaeographer,
M. Em. Chatelainl.

O was written in the middle of the ninth century in
the hand commonly used at that date in the Benedictine
monasteries of F rance and Germany. Nothing is known
of its history till 1479 when it was in the Cathedral library
at Mainz. How it came into the possession of Isaac Vossius
is not known. It has 20 lines to a page; very few con-
tractions are used; an attempt is made, without much
success, to separate the words ; there are a few interlinear
glosses of no value, but none after i 782. O has had
several correetors, who can be distinguished chiefly by the
different signs they used to mark mistakes. A Saxon or
Irish corrector has in many places supplied missing lines
