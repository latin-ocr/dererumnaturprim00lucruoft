NOTES 75

333. de summa. rerum: an ambiguous phrase: it means, either
‘concerning the unive1·se,' i.e. the composition of the universe (see
n. tol. 235); or ‘concerning the gist of the matter,’ i.e. the most
important points of the system. Ι prefer the latter explanation.

334 was not written by Lucr. For he was incapable of saying,
‘For these reasons void exists,’ before giving even the first of his
proofs. A further objection has been raised to locus intactus, which
does not occur elsewhere and is not an exact equivalent of ἀναφὴς
φύσις, used by Epicurus as a synonym for κενόν. But the first
objection is quite sufficient to condemn the verse.

It is also possible to explain its existence. In our best MS„ O,
there are occasional headings, each occupying a line, to explain
what is coming. Thus aster l. 334 O has DE INANI; and it is
likely that a verse was fabricated from the rest of this heading.
which may have run thus: quapropter locus sit, intactum, inane
natansque. Many of the extant headings begin with quare. After
l. 704 Ο has the following l.

neque zssgnem neque aera mque umorem principia esse
which is really a heading but was taken by the copyist for a. line of
the text3 sor it is not written, like other headings, in capitals, but
in the same letters as the text.

335. esset, sc. inane.

336. officium—officere, ‘that which is the way of body, i.e. to
get in the way...': in early Latin qfficz'um does not mean ‘duty'
(καθῆκον), but ‘activity,' ‘habitual practice,’ whether good or bad.

exstat=est2 see n. to 1. ¹¹9·

337. officere: a pun on qfficium: see n. to l. 65.

111 omm tempore, ‘under all conditions’: see n. to 1. 93.

adesset, ‘would apply to.’

339. ‘Since no <other> thing would be the first to give way.’

Body unmixed with void is found only in the at0m; and the
atom is absolutely unyielding and offers complete resistance.
Consequenssy, as motion is a fact proved by the senses, there must
be some element in the universe which offers no resistance: this
element is inane.

340· at nunc: see n. to L 110.

sublima caeli, ‘high heaven’: for the form os the adj„ cf. ii 845
slerz'la5 ii 1122 hilaro.
