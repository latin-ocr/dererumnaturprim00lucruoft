logical description.

1. Aeneadum genetrix: Lucr. strikes a national note: Venus,
mother of Aeneas, is also mother of his descendants, the Roman
people.

Just as the Aeneid is often referred to by Latin poets as Arma
uirumque, and Book i of Propertius as Cynthia, so the poem of
Lucr. is referred to by Ovid T rz‘st. ii 261 sumpserit, Aeneadum
genetrix ubi prima (if she takes up the work, where Aeneadum
genetrix comes first).

genetrix is the true spelling in spite of genitor: so meritus but
meretrix.

ιιοΙηρῖῐαεεήδονή. It is characteristic of Lucr. to put this word in
his first line. The chief grounds on which Epicurus was attacked
were these: (ι) his adoption of pleasure (ἡδονή) as the chief good;
(2) his denial of Providence. So the Stoic Hierocles (ap. Aul.
Gell. ix 5) ἡδονὴ τέλος, πόρνης δόγμα· οὐκ ἔστιν πρόνοια, οὐδὲ πόρνης
δόγμα (too bad even for a harlot). Far from concealing this un-
popular dogma, Lucr. gives it the utmost prominence: indeed, it is
possible that his determination to bring in ἡδονή suggested the
whole of this invocation. '

2. alma, ‘nurturing,’ connected with alere: applied also to nutrix
(v 230), water (ii 390), Pallas (vi 750).

eaell, followed by mare and terras: the three great divisions of
our world, repeated ll. 7-9 and often throughout the poem.

sig-na, ‘stars,’ whose silent steady motion is often described by the
verb labi: e.g. l. ¹034·

3. nauigerum‚ frugiferentis: Lucr. is the last of the Latin poets
to use, and to invent, compound words of this type. Virgil clearly
selt that they were unsuited to the language, and Quintilian agrees
with him, saying that such words, admirable in Greek, are often
ludicrous in Latin: i 5, 70 res tota magis Graecos decet; ...ideoque
