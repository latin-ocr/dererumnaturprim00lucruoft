100 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

ἐννόημα. (the simple sense) καθ’ ἕκαστον φθόγγον βλέπεσθαι
(Usener l. l. p. 5).

643. tangere, ‘to tickle.’

644. fucata sonore, lit., ‘coloured with sound’: a mixture of
metaphors surprising in Lucr.: it seems probable that he is mocking
the figurative style of Heracleitus.

645-689. T lze immense variety of visible things is inconsistent
with tlte view that they are all alike made of fire. For (1) if tlte
sartscles of fire retain their beat, anytlzing made out of tlzem would
be more or less lzot,· (observe also tlzat condensatt'on and rarefaction
os fiery particles is possible only τ’] void exim, whzclz is denied by
tlzese tlzz'nkers); and (2) tf tlte fiery particles do not retain their
heat, tlzey merely cease to exist and can produce nothing. Τ he fact is
tlzat there are certain material and unchangeable partz'cles, not made
cfffire themselves, which by virtue os their combz‘nation make stre, and
can, by a dzfferent method of combination, make other things, though
tlzey do not possess the sensiblequalilies possessed (gv llze things tltey make.

647. It will not help them, says Lucr., to maintain that hot things
are made of fiery particles closely packed, and cold things ol fiery
particles loosely packed.

649. naturam, ‘character,· i.e. hotness.

super, ‘as well’: an adv. osten used by Lucr.: the word belongs
to haberent and is misplaced here.

651. disque sipatis: for the tmesis made necessary by the metre,
cf. l. 452.

653. talibus in causis, ‘where the conditions are such’: this
idiomatic use ofin, common in all the best writers, cannot be trans-
lated literally.

narrantia, ‘diversity,’ is a word coined by Lucr. to take the place
os the unmetrical mfrse‘tas.

655-664 is a parenthesis, in which the argument of ll. 396, 397 is
more sully stated.

655. id quoque :premerem not used again by Lucr., but the
phrase occurs in Plautus and at least once in Ovid, Trzst. vg, 53,
where idque ila is a needless emendation.

faciant, ⁸ they were to assume': cf. l. 667: the subject os this and
the following verbs is qui materiem rerum esse putarunt} ignem
(1. 635), Le. the followers of Heracleitus.
