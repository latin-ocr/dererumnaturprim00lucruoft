NOTEs 107

753. huc accedit item=thirdly.

754. nattua, ‘to have birth‚'=mortalia: see n. to 1. 113. We
have seen that the atoms of Lucr. are both solida and aeterna.

755. utqui, aster accedit: also ii 17, iii 738, and (by conjecture)
ii 4²8· The word is common in Plautus (eg. capt. 553, J'rz'n. 637):
it means no more than ut: cf. at and atqui: the abl. of the pronoun
has become a mere enclitic conjunction or adverb hke πώς in Greek.

756. iam, ‘in that case.’

758. lam belongs to habebis: ‘you will understand already' irom
the proof given in ll. 159-264.

759. deinde=sourthly.

As subject os sunt, supply illorum primordia.

ueneno, ‘poisonous‚⁷ i.e. fatal: predicative dat.

760. congressa, ‘when they meet,' in the endeavour to make a
res: cf. l. 666.

761. tempestate coacta, ‘ when a storm has gathered': the verb
implies the paeking of thunder-clouds.

762. Note that this is not a mere illustration but an argument as
well: in a thunderstorm we see that three of the four elements,
represented by the lightning, the rain, and the wind, do actually
resuse to coalesce.

763-781. lee four elements, on thz's theory, are too much akin lo
the things they make, and are constantly being tramformed into them,
and back again. lt may be maintained that these e‹'emenls retain
their characteristics: isso, tlcey cannot unite to make atfflllzz'ng. T lte
particles wlziclz form the basis of matter must not be either lzot or cold,
zstlzey are to make both hot and cold things.

After refuting the Ionic philosophers in general, Lucr. now comes
to close quarters with the theory os four primary elements‚ and he
distinguishes two forms os it: (1) the form in which the elements
undergo change; (2) the form in which the elements remain un-
changed. The second is the theory of Empedocles.

763. rebus, ‘elements' here and 1. 764, but ‘products of the ele-
ments’ in ll. 765, 766: the ambiguity here is specially awkward: is it
possible that Lucr. intended to show by this means the importance
of a proper distinction between res and primordia, and to illustrate
the confusion caused by the absence os such a distinction? But one
cannot be sure of this, because ambiguity is so common in the poem.
