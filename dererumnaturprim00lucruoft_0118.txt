84 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

res has two senses here: with esse it=c0rpora; with geri it=
‘processes’: cf. ll. 129, 328.

443. Cf. Epicurus: τὸ κενὸν οὔτε ποιῆσαι οὔτε παθεῖν δύναται ἀλλὰ
κίνησιν μόνον δι’ ἑαυτοῦ τοῖς σώμασι παρέχεται (Usener l.l. p. 22).

444. uacans, ‘vacancy‚' is here treated as a noun.

445. per se goes with natura, as it did with rebus in l. 4¹9·

446. rerum ‘m numero=in rebus of l. 330, 399, 488 etc. : lit. ‘in
the list of things‚' i.e. in nature.

447, 448. Knowledge is derived (ι) from our senses, (2) from
reasoning based upon sense-knowledge.

apisci, ‘to grasp’: the compound adipisci was generally pre-
ferred to the simple form.

449—482. There are two classes qf things which exist merely in
relation to eitlzer body or void .· these are (ι) inseparable properam,-
(2) separable accz'dents. Time also llas no separate existence, but is
merely tlte accident qf occurrentes. T lle Stoics maz'nlaz'n llzat z'ncz'clents
of past history have separate existence ‚· but the trulla z‘s that all
incidents or occurrences exist merely in relation to one of tlte two
substances, body and void.

Coniuncta and euentu are the ternis used by Lucr. to represent
ἀίδια παρακολουθοῦντα and συμπτώματα of Epicurus.

449. quaecumque cluent, ‘whatever names these two things are
called,’ i.e. whatever qualities are predicated of body and void. The
subject, hae duae res, must be taken from the dat. which follows:
for this constr., see n. to 1. 1 5. Lucr. seems here to translate a phrase
of Epicurus in his discussion of this subject (Usener l. l. p. 22) ὅσα
κατηγορεῖται σώματος (all the qualities that are predicated of body).

The usual rendering, ‘whatever things are spoken of‚' is unsatis-
factory, because this must include body and void themselves. Also,
cluere seems always to be used with a predicate.

(This explanation is Mr Vesey's.)

450. harum: so Bernays sor horum of MSS.: the change seems
necessary, because horum could only refer to coniuncta.

45¹- nusquam, ‘in no case?

45²· discidio, ‘disruption‚’ notos the coniunctum but of the res to
which it belongs. Thus weight is the ‘inseparable property’ of a
stone (1. 453); and a stone which loses weight ceases to be a stone at all.

seque gregari: the tmesis is due to the requirements of the metre.
