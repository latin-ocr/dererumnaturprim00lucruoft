NOTES 131

noa—1113. < T he number of aloms must be infinite>‚ or else the
world womd be instantly destroyed. The firmament would be dis-
solved, tlte sky and tlze earth disappear, and everyllzing be resolved
into atoms. T lte process of destruction would begin at any point where
the store of atoms failed.

Lucr. here expands ll. 1017, 1018 into a magnificent picture of the
world’s destruction. He held that it would in no long time be
destroyed, and in the way here described.

1102. moenia mundi: see n. tol. 73.

1¹03· subito, ‘instantly‘: cs. l. 186.

¹¹04· cetera, ‘all other things‚' i.e. earth and sea, and all that
they contain.

1105. caeli tonitralia templa, ‘the region of the sky stored with
thunder.'

The aether is the first thing to disappear; next follows the aer, or
lower sky, the region of storrns.

tonitrualia, the true form of the adj., the verse will not admit.

superne, ‘from above’: cf. l. 496: this word is very common in
Lucr.‚ and always means ⁸ above’ or ‘from above.'

Giussani takes it here as ‘upwards ' (sor which Lucr. uses sursum).
He says that all the movements described are centrisugal: the sky
rushes up, the earth rushes down, both in the sorm of atomic dust.
But (ι) no authority before the elder Pliny is given sor this meaning
of superneg (2) permixtas rerum caelique ruinas of l. 1107 is against
this interpretation ; (3) caelum ruit, caeli ruina, are common in Latin
poetry (e.g. Terence H. Τ. 7ι9, Virg. Aen. i ¹²9), and always refer
to the sky falling down.

1106. omma. ‘all of it’ : fem. sing. agreeing with terra.

1107. rerum, being coupled with caeli, must mean ‘things be-
longing to earth!

1108, corpora soluentes, ‘letting their atoms go sree' : strictly
speaking, the res, not the ruinae, do this.

abeat, ‘should pass away.’

ιι 10. desertum=sine rebus, ‘untenantedff

caeca, ‘invisible'

Thus an imaginary spectator os the catastrophe would, when it
was completed in one moment, see—nothing.

These two lines reach the summit of the sublime and terrible
