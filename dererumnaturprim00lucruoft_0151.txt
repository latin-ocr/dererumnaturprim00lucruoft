NOTES 117

The position and movement of aloms which are mainly idenlical
make all the dzfference. Unless you admit the assentiat chffirence
between res and primordia, you will reaclz absurd conclusions.

Lucr. now expands the last example of the preceding paragraph.

897. in magma montibus: cf. Thuc. ii 77, 4 ἤδη ’γὰρ ἐν ὄρεσιν
ὕλη τριφθεῖσα ὑπ’ ἀνέμων πρὸς αὐτὴν α’πὸ ταύτομάτου πῦρ καὶ φλόγα.
ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ ἀνῆκε. We know that Lucr. had studied the work of
Thucydides.

900. flammai flore: this metaphor is used in Greek and appears
in the ‘Red Flower’ of theJungle Book.

fulserunt, ‘they blaze up,’ seems to imitate the Greek aorist of

901. scincet, ‘true’z cf. 1. 809.

902. semina ardoris, ‘atoms which make heat‚’ though not hot

two nouus suggested the addition of the favourite illustration: see
n. to l. 823.

914. cum, ‘though.’

distincta uoce, ‘by two distinct names,’ i.e. we mean two quite
different things, though the names sound alike.

915—920. A reductio ad absurdum to this effect: ‘if you say that
hot things cannot be hot, unless they are formed of hot atoms, then
you must say that a man, who laughs and weeps, cannot do 50,
unless each os his atoms can do the same.'

This playful argument, which has no special force against
Anaxagoras, is stated at greater length in Book ii 973-990, where
