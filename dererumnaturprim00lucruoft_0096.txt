62 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

156. quod sequimur, ‘the object of our search’: Epicurus uses
τὸ ζητούμενον in this sense.

inde, ‘thereasten’

157. perspiciemus, ‘ we shall ascertain.'

et...et, ‘both...and’: what follows explains quod sequimur.

unde, ‘out of what’ z we shall leam that all res are made up out
of atoms.

158. opera, ‘the hand‚' ‘the working.’ Not only the origin of
visible things will become clear to us, but the cause of phenomena
in general.

For the ending of the hexameter, cf. l. 184: in the Augustan
poets, a verse ending with two dissyllables has a monosyllable
before the first.

159-214. For consider all lz'vz'ng things, animal and vegetable‚
and mark their phenomena in regara' to (1) bz'rllz or parentage;
(2) season,· (3) growllz ; (4) marilian,- (5) sz'ze: in every case you will
find that tlze facts are against arbitrary creatz'on and in favour of tlte
Alomz'c T lzeory. (And tlzc same is true with regard to (6) culti-
vation.)

Lucr. does not attempt here to give formal proofs of the truth of
the theory: he is content to urge that the theory is the only way of
explaining a multitude of facts which we all know.

159· nam: the usual word to introduce the first of a series of
arguments: cf. l. 217.

ommbu': Cicero, writing at the beginning of 45 B.c., says that it
had been considered a refinement in his earlier days but was now a
provincialism‚ to drop the final s in pronouncing such words as
omnibus and dignus, when a consonant followed (Orator 161). In
this and other respects Lucr. deliberately adopted a somewhat
archaic style for his poem. See Introd. p. xvii.

160. nasci :gignit it applies to plants as well as animals.

semine egeret: srorn Epicurus (Usener Epicurea p. 5) οὐδὲν
’γίνεται ἐκ τοῦ μὴ ὄντος· πᾶν ’γὰρ ἐκ παντὸς ἐγίγνετ’ ἄν, σπερμάτων ’γε
οὐδὲν προσδεόμενον.

161. First, the source from which animals are produced does
not vary. Legend may say that Aphrodite sprang from the sea
soarn3 but facts show that living beings are not so produced, any
more than fish can grow, like trees, out os the ground.
