42 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

species uerna diei=the face of spring: uerna is the emphatic
word: diei has nearly the sense of temporis or anni.

ιι. reserata uiget, ‘is unbarred and blowing free': in winter it
was locked up in prison by Aeolus: if we admit the existence of
Venus, we can make no difficulty over Aeolus.

genitabilis aura Fauoni, ‘the birth-favouring breath of the west
wind! Adjectives in -bz'lz's are more osten passive3 but cf. l. 535
manabile frzg’us; Virg. Aen. x 481 penetrabile telum.

genitabilis is probably nom.: cf. Catull. 64, 282 aura..secunda
Fauoni.

Fauonius is the Latin name of ζέφυροςε it was expected to begin
blowing in Italy on Feb. 8 (Pliny Nat. Hist. xvi 93).

13. significant: by beginning to sing.

initum=ez¹ao6ov, ‘entering in’: see n. to l. 383.

14. inde, ‘next.’

ferae, ‘ maddened' by Venus: in Lucr. generally pecudes are the
tame anhnals, opposed to saecla ferarum.

Some read here ferae, pecudes, ‘the wild beasts and the tame’3
but wild beasts have nothing to do with pabula laeta.

laeta, ‘rich’: a stock epithet of crops and pastures: it was not
confined to poetry but was used even by country people in this
sense.

15. ita, lit. ‘in such wise': ⁸ sor’is a simpler English equivalent.

16. sequitur: the subject, quaeque, is placed as object in the
¹ relative clause which follows: a constant idiom in Luer.‚ e.g. ll. 170,
289, 361.

ι7. denique, ‘in short': cf. l. 76: but in Lucr. denique

generally: practerea, and serves to introduce a new argument:
cf. l. 2 38.

¹9· blandum amorem, ‘the spell of love.'

πο. saecla is used by Lucr. to supply the plur. of genus, of which
most cases are inconvenient or impossible in his metre: thrice only
(i 202, iii 948 and 1090) it means ‘generations’and denotes a period
of time.

21. quoniam etc.: the argument is: ‘Since you are the mistress
of Nature and the source os all Beauty, make beautiful my poem on
Nature, so as ιο be worthy os your votary, Memmiuss

rerum naturam here means 'the visible universe.'
