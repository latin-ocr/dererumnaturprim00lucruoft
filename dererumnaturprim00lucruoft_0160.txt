126 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

1015. diuum: not only our world, but the intermundia (see n. to
l. 74) which the gods inhabit would dissolve.

The passage implies that the gods, like all other res, are made of
atoms.

1016. sistere, ‘to hold together.'

10¹7· dispulsa, ‘forced asunder.’

1018. magnum=infinite‚ the hypothesis being that space is in-
finite and atoms limited.

1019. siue adeo potius, ‘or rather‘: either adeo or potius might
be omitted without altering the meaning.

concreta creasset, ‘ have combined to produce?

1020. cogi, ‘to be brought together.'

The proof ends here. What follows is an expansion of the thought
contained in ll. 995-997.

1021-1025 are repeated in Book v 419 foll.

1021. consilio, ‘by design.’ The rejection of a Final Cause was
a fundamental principle with Lucr. This l. may be a sarcastic
allusion to the Mind (νοῦς) which Anaxagoras believed to have
brought order into chaos.

1022. suo is a monosyllable ε sis is used for suis iii 1025.

¹0²3· darent, ‘they should impart ' to one another.

¹0²4· mutata, ‘changing their place’: the atoms themselves are
unchangeable: cf. l. 676.

1025. infinito, sc. tempore.

It is the infinite duration of time, combined with the infinite
number of atoms, which makes it possible for a swarm of atoms to
reach, by mere chance, the positions necessary for the formation of
a world. But, given these two conditions, every possible combina-
tion of atoms must, sooner or later, be realised.

plagia, ‘by blows’ of other atoms.

1026. motus and coetus are acc. plur„ omne genus being used
adverbially: cf. vi 917 lzocgenus in rebus (in matters of this kind).

1028. haec rerum summa: see n. to l. 235.

¹0²9· A further point: the preservation, as well as the creation,
of a world depends upon an infinite supply of atoms.

magnos...annos: probably an allusion to the magnus annus or
cycle of the StoicS, who held that all events repeated themselves
exactly at an interval of 18‚000 years. Some echo of this is heard
