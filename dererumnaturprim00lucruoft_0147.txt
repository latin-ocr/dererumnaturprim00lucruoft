N OTES 113

830. homoeomerian, lit. ‘similarity of parts,’ i.e. the theory that
every res is composcd os primordia possessing the qualities of the
res: examples are given by Lucr. Anaxagoras, like Empedocles,
taught that his particles, osten called by him σπέρματα, were im-
perishable.

831. Grai: an Epic form, always used by Lucr. sor Graeci.

832. sermonis egestas: see n. to l. 139: it is not exactly the
poverty os Latin that is at fault here, but its inability to translate
ὁμοιομέρειαι by a single word: see n. to l. 3.

8 3 3. ipsam rem, ‘the actual theory’ as distinct from its name.

834 foll. 'l'he examples chosen are these: (r) three animal sub-
stances3 (2) a metal; (ς) three of the four elements.

The third class of examples misrepresents Anaxagoras, who taught
that the sour elements were not ὁμοιομερῆ but ‘rubbish-heaps'
akin to the original chaos, as it was before Mind brought it into
order.

834. principio: no deinde follows in l. 843 where the second
point is stated.

835. uidelicet, ‘you must know.’

pauxillis = paruz'ssim is.

836. hic: pronoun: i.e. Anaxagoras.

837. uisceribus: in Lucr. uiscera never means ‘entrails‚’ but
always ‘flesh‚’ all that comes between the skin and bone: this is
the regular meaning in early Latin: cf. Plaut. Mil. Gl. 30 per corium
per uiscera, Ι perque os elephanti transmineret bracchium.

839. auri: Bentley suggested aurae here and auram below, to
complete the list of the four elements: but (1) Lucr. elsewhere (eg.
1. 853) omits one element srom the list; (2) mica is a suitahle word
for a ‘grain’ of metal but not suitable for a ‘particle’ of air.

841. ignibus ex: this position of ex is common in Luca: he even
ends a line (ii 79¹) and sentence with uariis ex.

842. esse must be supplied after putat: ‘and all other things he
imagines and supposes to exist in like manner.'

843, 844. Cf. ll. 742 soll.

ulla. ex parte, ‘anywhere.’ 111 rebus=in rerum numero.

847. adde quod=thirdly.

848. si...sunt=if they deserve the name: ‘I ought not to call
thern by that name‚’ he means: cf. l. ¹057·
