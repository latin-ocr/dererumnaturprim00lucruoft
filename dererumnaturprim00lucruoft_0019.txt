the orator himseli or his brother Quintus. Munro's con-
clusions are now generally accepted—that Marcus Cicero
was the so-ealled editor, that he gave the poem to the
world exactly as it was left by the author, and that he is
likely to have employed the services of Atticus in the
production; for Atticus owned a large copying-establish-
ment and himself professed the philosophy of Epicurus.

It was said above that Cicero mentions the poet in a
letter written to his brother at the beginning of the year
54 B.c., a few months after the poet’s death. In all the
works of Cicero there is no other mention of Lucretius
by name. Cicero's taste in poetry is well known: a hearty
admirer of Ennius and his school, he felt something
between amusement and contempt for those writers
of the day who were endeavouring‚ with Catullus and
Calvus as their leaders, to reproduce the learned art of
the Alexandrian scholarsl. We should expect to find in
Cicero unbounded admiration for a poem so fresh and
strong and native as the De Rerum Natura. But what he
says on the subject to his brother, if not unappreciative,
is certainly disappointing in its coolness and brevity. He
wrote thus:

Lucreti poemata, ut scribis, ita sunt, multis luminibus
ingenii, multae tamen artis ².

Quintus had expressed his opinion, and Cicero now
concurs in it. His words probably mean: ‘I agree with
your estimate of the poem of Lucretius. It displays not
only the native genius (ingenium) of the early Roman
poets, but also that art of finished execution (ars) which
our modern poets have imitated from the Alexandrians³.'
But all the editors of Cicero's Letters used to insert a non
