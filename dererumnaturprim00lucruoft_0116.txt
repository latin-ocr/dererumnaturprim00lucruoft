82 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

per se belongs to rebus, not to cst: other things, as we shall see,
exist in relation to body or void3 but body and void exist per se, i.e.
are substances: cf. ll. 422, 440, 459.

420. constitlt=conslat‚ ‘consists’: a common use of this past
tense, e.g. iii 178: cf. συνέστηκε.

corpora here=‘ atoms ἐ but in l. 422 corpus is not ‘an atom,’ but
¹ matter ’ i.e. aliquid quod tangi potest. The existence of matter
formed of atoms is proved by sensation, but the existence of atoms
could never be so proved.

4²¹· Space, in which bodies are placed, is properly locus (τόπος);
space, through which bodies move, is spatium (χώρα); neither of these
is synonymous with inane (κενόν).

dluerfla„ ‘in different directions)

The atoms move and have their being in void, like fish in the seat
see n. to 1. 969.

422. per se...sensus=a2'trv¹2 ⁷'1 αἴσθησις of Epicurus, ‘sensation of
itself.’

communis, ‘common to all men,' appears to be a translation of
ἐπὶ πάντων.

That the existence of matter is proved by sensation, was the belief
of Dr Johnson also. Boswell asked him whether it was possible to
refute Berkeley's doctrine that matter has no existence: ‘1 never
shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered, striking his
foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from
it, “I refute it thus!”’ The sensus of his toe seemed to Johnson
sufficient proof of the existence of the stone.

423. 0111, governed by fides, ‘our belief in it‚’ i.e. in sensation.

This belief Lucr. here and iv 505 calls prima fides, meaning that
sensation is the original source of all knowledge. According to
Epicurus, sensation is the standard of truth, and every impression of
the senses is clear evidence (ἐνάργεια) ; Lucr. uses the adj. manifestum
to render this technical term. See n. to l. 694.

fundata ualebit, ‘is firmly established?

4²4· haud erit, ‘there will be no standard’z a noun is required in
English.

occultis rebus, ‘the invisible world‚’ τὸ ἄδηλον of Epicurus. Lucr.
uses this phrase to denote the invisible atoms and invisible void: see
n. to 1. 145.
