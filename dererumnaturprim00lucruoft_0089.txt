NOTES 55

quemquam uexaret eorum; and for the metaphor os turbare, cf. iii
37 metus illc Acheruntis, Ι funditus humanam qui ultam turbat ab
imo.

Lucr. is reproducing a text of Epicurus (Usener Epicurea p. 30):
ἐκεῖνο δεῖ κατανοεῖν ὅτι τάραχος ὁ κυριώτατος ταῖς ἀνθρωπίναις ψυχαῖς
’γίγνεται ἐν τῴ αἰώνιόν τι δεινὸν προσδοκᾶν καὶ ὑποπτεύειν κατὰ τοὺς
μύθους.

107. certam: finis is regularly sem. in Lucr.: in ii 1116 the MSS.
give extremum...finem‚ but edd. read extremam.

109. reug-ionibus atque minis, ‘the superstitious threats.'

This rhyfflm, in which the second foot‚ being a dactyl‚ ends with
the end of a word, is common in Lucr. but hardly occurs in later
writers of hexameter verse.

ιιο. nunc, ‘but as it is,' i.e. because they see no end: this
logical nunc, following an unrealised condition, is very common in
Lucr„ eg. ll. 169, 244, 340.

ratio, ‘means’

restandi = resislendz'.

111. poenas ..timendumst: the constr„ common in Lucr. (cf.
l. 138). is rare elsewhere: of the two constructions found in Greek
-φοβητέον ἐστὶ τιμωρίας and φοβητέαι εἰσὶ τιμωρίαι, Latin early
discarded the tormer.

in morte. ‘aster death’z lit. ‘ in the state of death,’ ἐν τῷ τεθνάναι.

112. ignoratur: homines ignorant.

113. This Ι. states two opposite theories os the soul's origin: the
first, that of Epicurus, teaches that the soul is born with the body;
the second, that the soul existed before the body and finds its way
into the body at birth.

nata: naliua and therefore: mortalis, because everything that
was born must die: cf. iii 4¹7 nunc age, natiuos animantibus et
mortalis Ι esse animos animasque leues ut noscere possis.

nascentibus insinuetur: supply hominibus: cs. iii 670 siimmort-
alis natura animai l constat, et in corpus nascentibus insinuatur.
The ancient champions os the soul‘s immortality‚ chiefly the Platonists
and Pythagoreans, believed that the lise of the soul extends back-
ward into the infinite past as well as forwards into the endless
future: whereas the modern popular beliefisthat the soul was born,
or created, but will never die.
