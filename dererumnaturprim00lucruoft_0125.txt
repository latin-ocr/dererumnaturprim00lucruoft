NOTES 91

527. pleno: abl. osa noun plenum.

distinguere, ‘to vary?

inane, here an adj., is elsewhere in Lucr. a noun.

528. The aeternitas of atoms is now stated, and two prooss given
⁵3²·539 and 540-550)·

Lucr. conceives that things are destroyed in either of two ways,
either by assault from without, or by dissolution from withinz cf.
ll. 222, ²23·

5²9· retexi, ἀναλύεσθαι, ‘to have their fabric undone.'

53¹ offers another difficulty. To what previous passage does Lucr.
refer? Some say, to l. 485; others to 518, 519. But the clearest
statement os the matter begins with the very next line. Hence some
commentators place ll. 532-539 aster l. 519.

53 3. nec findi in bina secando: a translation of ἄτομος, which he
never uses. Cf. Epicurus (Usener l.l. p. ¹9¹) εἴρηται ἄτομος,...ὄτι ού
δύναται τμηθῆναι.

534. manabile, ‘permeating’z see n. to 1. 11.

536. quo...mag1s: osten in Lucr. followed by tam magis for eo
magis.

537. rebus=enemies.

penitus, ‘ thoroughly.’

540. praeterea = secondly.

This second proof has served another purpose already (ll. 225-
²37) and is put hriefly here.

541. antehac is here a spondee.

543· supra: i.e. ll. ¹49 foll.

546. quo=ut in ea.

quaeque :res omncs.

supremo tempore, ‘at their last hour': he speaks as if all res
were living things.

547. ‘That there may be a constant supply of atoms for making
new things' (not ‘sor making things new ').

suppeditet has the sense of suppetat: cs. l. 1040.

548-550. The pauci uersus, in which Lucr. promised to prove
two qualities of atoms (1. 499), apparently end here, and he now
sums up.

But the reader will observe that a new term, simplicitas, appears
here sor the first time and is repeated below in ll. 574, 609, 6η.
