116 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

‘'l'he things which have their nourishment in our body' are the
ossa, uenae, nerui of l. 862 foll.

884. ‘And that, when we grind it (i.e. fruges) between stone and
stone, blood should flow freely.’

lapidi :ln lapidem, lit. ‘with stone against stone.'

Two stages os grinding seem to be distinguished, the grain being
first broken and then pulverised (so Giussani). Munro keeps herbis
but transposes ll. 884, 885, and believes that in 884 Lucr. is
referring to the food of sheep3 but this is open to the objection
that all the illustrations of Lucr. are taken from actual life, and no
one ever does rub blades of grass between two stones.

The lapides are therefore the upper and lower millstones: cs.
Plaut. Asin. 31 num me illuc ducis ubi lapis lapidem terit? i.e. acl
pistrinum.

885. herbas, which sheep eat.

decebat = conueniebat above.

886. 1at10es, ‘water‚' which sheep drink.

Note that herbas et latices correspond exactly to cibus aridus et
liquor os 1. 864.

887. The constr„ awkward enough, is mittere dulcis μαίας et
lali sapore, quali oues sunt lactis ubere, ‘should yield sweet drops,
i.e. like in flavour to the udder of milk which sheep have.’

If ubera be read with Lambinus, lantgerae is gen. or dat. sing.

For lanigerae: oues, see n. to l. 372.

888. The second example begins here: cf. l. 867.

889. uideri, ‘should be seen‚' governed by decebat.

890. minute, ‘in miniature.'

891. The third example begins here: cf. l. 871.

893. manifesta: cf. l. 188: Lucr. uses this word to translate
ἐναργής of Epicurus: it means ‘certainly true, because obvious to
the semes?

894. res, ‘created things,’ with perceptible qualities, as opposed
to the invisible atom with no secondary qualities.

895. semina, ‘atoms.' Cf. ll. 814, 815.

897-920. Fire may be kz'mlled by branc hes of trees rubbz'ng
together ,· but tlzis does not prove the presence offire in wood. Fire is
due to a fresh distribution of the aloms composing tlze wood. If
there were actual fire in wood, all forests would be burnt up at once.
