78 DE RERVM NATVRA‚ LIBER PRIMVS

latices = aquam.

umentibus: Lucr. uses niti of au forms of motion, walking and
flying as well as swimming.

373. nqmdas uias, ‘a watery way': a reminiscence of the
Homeric ὑγρὰ κέλευθα.

post: adverb.

374. unquant: subjunctive of oratio obliqua.

The opponents of void say that, when a fish swims, the water
makes way in front and flows to the space in its wake. No, says
Lucra neither fish nor water could move till the other had moved
to make room for it.

According to Luer.‚ the fish are able to move because there are

, void spaces (inania) in the water.

375. inter se—locum, ‘can move by exchanging places': inter
se, in spite of its position, refers wholly to mulare.

376. quamuis—plena, ‘although all things ate sull,' i.e. although
there is no void in the universe.

377. scincet, ‘you must know.’

totum acts as an adv. qualifying falsa, ‘wholly salse.

378. quo, ‘in what direction?‘

tandem, = ‘l ask,' adds liveliness to the question.

381. priuandumst corpora: see n. to l. 111.

38²· admixtum rebus: seen. tol. 369.

383. initum, ‘beginning': used here and elsewhere by Lucr. to
represent ἀρχή, because his metre rejects the proper word initium:
not to be confused with z'nz'lum of 1. ι 3.

mouendi=roo κινεῖσθαι.

384. postremo introduces the second section of the paragraph:
perhaps it is used here because this Section ends the whole discussion
about void.

de concursu, ‘immediately aster contact.'

lata. seems to have the sense of plana, ‘smooth’z the two sursaces
must meet at every point, if no air is to be left between thern.

Giussani suggests, with great probability, that these bodies are a
pair of cymbals which clash and part. Lucr. takes his illustrations
stom real life, not from a text-book on mechanica.

385. cita: quiekly.

nempe, ‘it is true.'
