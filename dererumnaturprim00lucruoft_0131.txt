N OTES 97

Epicurus was willing to concede that the number os parts was very
small.

exstat: est.

602. minima constat. natura, ‘is a minimum‘: minimum is here
a technical term, denoting ‘ultimate least thing in namne)

nec fuit, ‘and has not existed?

604. ‘Since it is essentially (ipsum) a primary part and a single
part of the other thing‚‘ i.e. os the atom.

tpsum :per se.

606. agmine condenso, ‘in serried ranks': nota mere metaphor:
the atom contains no void.

naturam corporis, ‘the atoni)

The language seems to suggest more than three parts, in spite of
the passage quoted above.

608. haerere: sc. ibi.

609-612. It will be found convenient to translate primordia here
by ‘the atom,' the plur. being reserved for its parts.

610. ‘It is massed together and coheres closely by means os its
least parts)

arte: adv.

611. Lucr. here rules out a heresy, much in the manner os the
Athanasian creed: primordia meet in concilium to make a res3 but
it must not be supposed that an atom itself is formed by the
assemblage (conuentu) of its parts.

612. magis=potiusz cf. l. 481.

613. unde, ‘from it‚’ i.e. the atom.

iam, ‘furthen’

615. praeterea introduces a second argument for the existence
of these parts, the first having been drawn srom analogy3 the second
is a reductio ad absurdum.

pasuissima quaeque, ‘all very small bodies': this superlative is
used by Lucr. elsewhere, e.g. iii 199: here it differs in sense from
the technical minimum.

617. quippe ubl, ‘since in that case’: cf. 1. 24²·

pars, i.e. dimidia pars.

618. nec res ulla=et nil.

praefiniet, ‘will put an end to the division)

619. rerum summam, ‘the universe.’
