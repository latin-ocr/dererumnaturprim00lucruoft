92 DE RERVM NATVRA‚ LIBER PRIMVS

There is much difference of opinion here. Giussani considers sim—
plicitas to be a third distinct quality of atoms, which was proved
separately; if this be so, then something has been lost aster 1. 547,
and these lines are the summing up of a missing proof. As against
Giussani's view, it may be noted: (1) that in the final summary of
the discussion in l. 627 soliditas and aeternitas appear alone, with
no mention os simplicz'tas; (2) that simplicitas never occurs through-
out the discussion without an epithet‚ either solida or aeterna.

Others maintain that solida simplicitas is a mere equivalent for
soliditas which the metre will not admit.

But simplicitas is not merely a synonym of soliditas. For some
philosophers, notably Anaxagoras and Empedocles, taught that the
particles of matter were both ‘solid' and eternal but yet infinitely
divisible. In the view os Lucretius, simplicitas is a consequence of
soliditas: because atoms are solida ‘free from void,’ therefore they
are simplicia, ‘one and indivisible' (cf. l„ 533, ll. 609 soll.). It is
mainly this latter quality of atoms that Lucr. is proving, from this
point down to 1. 634. There is undeniable obscurity in the transition,
and sor this Lucr. is apparently responsible.

551-564. T hat aloms are indivz'sible is proved by tlte evidence of tlte
semes. For eaclz kind of animal is reproduced and comes to maturz'ty
at an age which remains constant for tlte species. But, because
destruction is more rapid tlzan construction, two consequences would
follow, z'fatoms were divisz'ble .· (1) rcproduction would ccase altogether ,-
and (2) tlte period quaturity ofeaclz kind would grow later and later.

Lucr. conceives that the atoms into which a res is dissolved, are
used sor the creation of a fresh res in a later generation. But, because
destruction is more rapid than reconstruction, the atoms, if infinitely
divisible, will be suffering dissolution saster than nature can combine
them. Thus each generation will start from smaller atoms than its
predecessors, so that each new combination will take a longer time
to complete.

55²· frangendis rebus, ‘to the divisibility of matter!

iam, ‘by this time.’

redacta, ‘reduced’ in size.

aeuo: the infinite duration of time is essentia] to the argument.
