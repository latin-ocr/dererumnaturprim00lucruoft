86 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

461. instet, ‘is present now': this use 0¹ instare is perhaps taken
srom Greek, where e'veareb5=‘present’: it is seen in our phrase, ‘on
the roth inst.,' i-e. of the present month-

porro=third1y.

deinde sequatur, ‘follows later,' i.e. the future.

462. The non contained in nec belongs to sentire.

per se tempus, ‘time in the abstract': cf. per se rebus (l. 419).

463. rerum belongs to quiete as much as to motu.

Compare the definition of Epicurus quoted above.

464. From time Lucr. now passes to the occurrences of past
history, and states that these are all merely cuenla of corpus and
locus. He adorns his argument by selecting the Trojan war as a type
of actions and passions in the past.

demque, ‘furthen’ He begins by refuting a fallaey, and then
starts the statement of his own view with a second denique (l. 471).

Tyndaridem-esse, ‘when men say that occurrenoes, such as the
rape of Helen and the conquest of the Trojans by warfare, exist....’

465. dicunt: the unexpressed subject is ‘the Stoics‚’ who held
that time had independent existence.

466. per se goes with esse.

467-470. The Stoics prove the separate existence of past incidents
thus: ‘the men who fought at Troy are long dead: therefore their
actions and passions (euenta) have existence apart from the men (per
se sunt).’ No, says Luer. (ll. 469, 47o): the men are dead, but the
place remains, and the actions and passions are euenta loci as well as
euenta corporis.

468. abstulerit: subj. of oratio obliqua: this is the argument used
by the Stoics. aetaS, ‘time.'

469. terris of MSS.‚ constantly emended, was explained by R. L.
Dunbabin (Classical Quarlerly July 1917) to mean ‘the world,’
and regiones ‘particular districts,' such as Troy: so Virg. Aen. i 460
quae regio in terris nostri uon plena laboris? Of the events os past
history some (aliud) have affected the whole world, others (aliud)
only particular districts. Munro read Teucris and Bernays saeclis, to
represent corpus; but it is not necessary that corpus should be
referred to here.

471. denique, ‘further,’ =‘the fact is.' Having disposed of the
Stoic argument, Lucr. now proceeds to state his own view.
