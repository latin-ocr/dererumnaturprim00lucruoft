58 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

127. cum, ‘not only‚’ answered by tum (‘but also') in l. 130.

superis de rebUS‚ περὶ τῶν μετεώρων, ‘coneerning celestial
phenomenass

habenda, ‘must be grasped.'

128. ratio, ‘principle'3 l. 1²9 ratione, ‘manner’; 1. ¹:50 ratione,
‘reasoning’z Lucr. works this word hard: such persistent repeti-
tion, with different meanings or not, seems to us excessrve3 but
Lucr. must have liked it.

solis cet.: he now explains what superae res are: sor another

Lucr.‚ see n. to 1. 4¹9·

uidendum, sc. est.

¹3²-135 come in abruptly: it is likely that Lucr.‚ while writing
Book iv, inserted them provisionally here. The point is this:
ghosts‚ which you might suppose to prove the survival of the soul,
do not really prove it. In Book iv he explains that ghosts are
material emanations from the living body which happen to surviveit.

132. et: supply uiuendum est.

Cf. iv 35 simulacra... 1 quae, quasi membranae summo de corpore
rerum 1 dereptae, uolitant astroque citroque per auras, Ι atque eadem,
nobis uzgilamtz'bus obuia, mentis Ι terrificant atque in somnis.

uigilantibus is to be taken with morbo azz‘feclis: in sleep a man
may see a ghost without fear; but if he sees one while awake, it is a
