With regard to the diction and metre of the poem,
Lucretius deliberately adopted a style which must have
seemed archaic to his contemporaries. This may be seen
by comparing the De Rerum Natum with the Peleus and
Thetis of Catullus, which was certainly written at nearly
the same time. As Greek epic verse continued to the end
to repeat the forms and vocabulary of Homer, so Lucre-
tius chose for his model the Annales of Ennius, the one
great epic which the language possessed, though two
centuries had passed since it was written. At the beginning
of his own poem he speaks with high admiration of Ennius,
and often imitates even the few hundred lines of frag-
ments which we possess. It is probable too that his
archaism was intended as a protest against the tendency
of contemporary writers. For in his time there was great
literary activity among the Romans. Any educated man,
Mommsen says, could turn out his five hundred hexa-
meters at a sitting; Quintus Cicero wrote four tragedies
in a fortnight to beguile the dulness of winter-quarters
in Gaul. But most of this poetry was bad imitation of
such second-rate models as Callimachus and the other
academie poets of Alexandria. The pure taste of Lucretius,
revolting from the predominant fashion, attached itself
to Ennius and, through Ennius, to the great Greeks of
a former age. His philosophical creed and his taste in
literature alike led him to discard antiquarian and mytho-
logieal lumber. The mythology he refused to believe, and
he valued no learning except that which had power to
relieve the life of man from unhappiness and degradation.

His archaism is seen both in language and in style. He
uses old words and forms, from which Virgil selects with
discrimination; and also—though this is often due to

was the first to insist on this sign of imperfectiori in the text
of Lucretius.
