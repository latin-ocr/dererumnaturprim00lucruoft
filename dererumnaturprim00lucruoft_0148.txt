114 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

constant = sunt.

849. ree, ‘the things they make.’

85ο. refrenat: supply ea as object: for the constr.‚ see n. to
1. *21-

851. dentibus: death is compared to a devouring animal: no
exact parallel is quoted.

853. sanguen: sanguis of MSS. cannot be right, because in Lucr.
sanguis is a spondee.

854. ubi=quoniam.

funditus, ‘essentially,’ goes with mortalis.

857. neque autem crescere=et ne crescere quidem, ‘and also
cannot grow.’

858. The constr. is ellipticalz ‘I appeal to facts, <to show>
that....'

ante: i.e. ll. 159-264.

859-874. A dilemma will disprove tlzz's theory of Anaxagoras in
any case you choose lo select: e.g. (1) the nutrition qf tlte human body ;
(2) theformalion of lrees anciplanls ,· (3) tlze rgnitz'on of wood.

The dilemma may be stated thus: since our body grows from
food, the particles of sood must be either like the body and therefore
unlike the food, or like the food and therefore different from the
body: therefore either the food or the body is ἀνομοιομερές, i.e.
composed of particles unlike itself.

The argument will be clearer, if the view of Lucr., that animals
normally seed on plants, be kept in mind : think of an Irish labourer
who turns potatoes into bone and muscle.

860. The l. in italics which follows is required by the sense and
was supplied by Lambinus, without any intimation that he wrote it
himself.

861. commixto corporo, ‘of a mixed substance': but corpora
parua below=particles.

dicent: the indefinite plural, which we have often had before,
e.g. 1. 65 52 it refers here to believers in ὀμοιομέρεισ..

862. esse: see n. to 1. ²4·

863. omnino, ‘to complete the list’ (Munro).

864. ipse, taken with cibus (so Giussani) has much more point
than if taken, as it used to be, with liquor.

865. rebus, ‘substances.'
