96 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

599—634. We infer that the atom has parts, (1) from the analogy
of other corpora. The nature of these parts is an additional proof
that the alom itself is indivisible. The existence of these parts is
further necessary, because (2) otherwise, infinites being equal, the
universe would be equal to the smallest object z't contains ,· (3) without
these parts, atoms would not possess those properties which are
indispensablefhr the making of res.

We now leam that there are not two but four gradations of
corpus: (1) res, e.g. a house or amaru (2) rei cacumen, the smallest
part of a res which our eyes can grasp3 (3) the atom3 (4) the
cacumen os the amm, also called minima pars, which is the subject
os this paragraph. 'she first two are perceptible by the senses
(αἰσθητά) ; the last two only by the reason (θεωρητά).

It would be natural to suppose that an object consisting of parts
can be divided into those parts. It is characteristic of Lucr. to
carry the war into the enemy's country, by insisting that the nature
of these parts is a fresh proof of the indivisibility of the atom.

Guided by ll. 749-752 and by a text os Epicurus (ταύτῃ τῇ ἀναλογίᾳ
νομιστέον καὶ τὸ ἐν τῇ ἀτόμῳ ἐλάχιστον κεχρῆσθαι, ‘we must suppose
that the minimum in the atom follows this analogy' of the minimum
in visible things), he divined that some lines had been lost owing to
similar endings, and suggested the supplement here printed in italics.

599. quodque, ‘in each case': cs. l. 578: the full phrase would
be sunt sua cacumina quibusque corporibus.

cacumen, πέρας, ‘bounding-point ’z the term is misleading,
because it suggests the ‘top’ of an object; whereas both res and
atoms consist entirely of cacumina. See n. to ll. 749, 750.

600. corporis, i.e. the invisible arom.

601. iam nequeunt, ‘cannot include' in their vision τ an idiomatic
iam: cf. Cic. De Fz'n. v 14 Hieronymum, quem iam cur Peri-
pateticum appellem nescio (why I should include him in the list). In
these and similar cases, the literal translation, ‘no longer,' is
bad English.

1d, i.e. the cacumen or part of the atom.

These parts are mentioned in only one other place in the poem—
ii 485 fac enim minimis e partibus esse Ι corpora prima tribus, uel
paulo pluribus auge. Convinced that some parts were necessary,
