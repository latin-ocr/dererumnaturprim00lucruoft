52 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

81. imma, ‘ atheistic‚’ because the Epicureans denied Providenee.
By a principle common in Latin verse, impia, though connected by
grammar with elementa, really belongs to rationis: it is the ‘system’
which is atheistic, and the ‘rudiments ' of it are presumably less so
than the advanced teaching. Lucr. takes this liberty, to avoid the
cretic impiae.

elementa, ‘alphabet‚’ ‘A B C‚’ ¹ rudiments.’

82. indugredi : indu is an old form os in, seen in ind-uere (cf. ex-
uere) : Lucr. uses it to avoid the unmetrical ingrad& and all writers
os dactylic verse, if determined to use the word ῖυιρἔᾱίον, must use
the form induperator.

quod contra, ‘whereas on the contrary’= cs. l. 221 quodnam:
the same fossilised quod is seen in quodsi.

illaexpresses contempt or anger: istaiscommonerin the sormercase.

83. scelerosa atque impia: the same charges, in reverse order,
are retorted against religion. But Lucr. has resorted to an artifice:
he now uses impius with a different meaning, as ‘unnatural': the
action of Agamemnon was impium, because it was contrary to the
natural tie that binds father and child.

84. quo pacto, ‘thus’: cf. l. 912.

Triuial uirginis: Artemis: cf. Catull. 34, 15: the origin of the
title was unknown even in Varro's time.

85. Iphianassai ι Lucr. treats this as another name for Iphigeneia.
He appears to have made a mistake: for in Homer (ll. ix ¹45)
Agamemnon, during the Trojan war, says that he has three daughters
living—Chrysothemis, Laodice (the Homerie name of Electra), and
Iphianassa; and Sophocles (Elect. 158) speaks of Iphianassa as
living after the murder of Agamemnon. Thus the Greek authorities
clearly distinguish the two daughters.

86. prima uirorum, ‘chief of men’: the neut. plur. is unusual
but is so used by Ovid Am. i 9, 37 summa ducum (the chief com-
mandes), Atrides: there are many parallels in Greek.

87. infula: worn by her as the victim.

commun, ‘ tresses‚’ is governed by circum in circumdata.

88. The order is: profusa est pari parte (in equal lengths) ex
utraque malarum: cf. v 674 et pariter ( :pari parte) mollem malis

dentium-e barbam. An order so ambiguous is contrary to the practice
os the Augustan poets.
