NOTES 93

554. ‘That no thing, formed out of those atoms‚ could within a
fixed time reach the perfect development of its being.'

555. conceptum=compositum‚ but suggests the live animal.

ad auctum: so Munro sorstnis of MSS-2 this 1. came last on p. 23
os the original MS„ at the foot of the right-hand page: the genuine
reading having perished through wear and tear of the page‚finis,
which gives neither sense nor grammar, was inserted from the
context: see ll. 561, 577, 584.

557. dies et: so Madvig sor diei of MSS.: cf. l. 233· There is no
other example in Lucr. os el ending a line; but the complication of
the double genitive seems equally unexampled. Munro, who keeps
diei, translates thus: ‘the long, the infinite duration os all bygone
time’; which takes no account of diei.

559. fregisset: the subjunctive is due to the attraction of posset:
cf. l. 522.

560. relicuo: cs. iii 648, iv 976. The convenient form reliquus
(v-z) is used only by the post-Augustam poets: in Plautus the
scansion is relevans: Lucr. lengthens the first syll. (as in religio) and
so can use it in his verse. Virgil, Horace, and Ovid never use the
word, prevented by the three short syllables with which it begins.

reparari, ‘be reproduced.’

562, refici, ‘is repeated)

rem quamque, ‘each kind os creature)

563. ·And also that definite periods are fixed sor creatures ac-
cording to their kind....'

For example, all horses come to maturity in three years. The
reason is that the atoms‚ which form the starting-point for the
making of a new horse, remain for ever identical. If the atoms
could grow smaller, each new generation of horses would take longer
to come to maturity.

565-576. θ’ it z's true tlzat atoms are perfectly solid, it is newertheless
possible to explain the existence qf 51·ss res by llze presence of widin
them ,· but, {salom-s are sost, it is impossible to explain the existence
‘ff hard res such as z'ron and stone.

This seems to me to be an argument sor soliditas and not sor in-
divisibility: inl. 574 the emphasis may fall on solida. Giussani‚ how-
ever, differsz he explains mollia in l. 570 as :fragilia, i.e. divisible.
But where else in Lucr. has mollis this meaning?
