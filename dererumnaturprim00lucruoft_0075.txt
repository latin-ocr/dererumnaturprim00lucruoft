Nonis 41

cum κυρταύχενα mirati sumus, ‘ insurm'ccrm‘sum ' uix a risu
dffendt'mus. Tuis limitation has descendet] to the Romance languages:
how inferior French is to German in the power of forming com-
pound words !

terras frugiferentis: the rhythm is notable. Virgil would write
terras quae stu, and later poets followed him in this matter. But
Lucr. prefers that the fourth soot should be a spondee and should
end with the end osa word: of the first ten lines seven are on this
model. In consequence of this practice, his hexameter laeks
variety. compared with Virgil's, but gains a force and stability of its
own.

4. concelebras, ‘fillest with thy presence’: cf. ii 344 uolucres...
quae loca...c0ncelebrant: the verb has generally a plur. subject but
is properly used os Venus because she is omnipresent.

quoniam: the argument is this: Venus must be everywhere,
because she creates everything.

animantum: Lucr. uses animantes as a noun (sem.) equivalent
to animalia: the sing. animal he uses only once (v 823).

5. exortum: i.e. stom the womb of the mother.

lumina: poetical sor lumen: so, esp. in Ovid, corpora for corpus,
nomina for nomen etc.

6 soll. Spring is identified with the coming os Venus, because
animals mate at that season. So, in a pageant os the seasons, Spring
and Venus go together: v 737 it uer et Venus, et Veneris praenuntius
ante Ι pennatus (winged Cupid) graditur.

The winds and clouds of winter flee at her approach.

tugiunt is the main verb: all that precedes is apostrophe.

7. daedala, ‘manifold in works': this borrowed word (it is the
Greek δαιδάλεος) is sometimes active in Lucr., sometimes passive:
it is active here and iv 551 uerborum daeanzla lingua (the tongue‚
the deit shaper of words), but passive v ¹45¹ daedala szgna (cun-
ningly wrought statues).

8. submittit. ἀνίησι, ‘sends up srom beneath.'

aequora ponti, ‘the levels of the sea': spring has made it smooth
and calm.

10. nam: the proof of the connexion between Venus and Spring
follows: it is proved by the love-songs of the birds and the mating
of all animals.
