NorEs 47

participle is best translated by a verb. Lucr. seems to compare his
poem to a feast which he has spread for Memmius: cf. iii 12 depasci-
mur aurea dicta.

54. summa...deumque‚ ‘the high lore of heaven and of the gods,’
i.e. the theory of the heavenly bodies (τὰ μετέωρα; cf. 1. 127) and
of the gods: these are combined, because common belief supposes
the gods to inhabit the sky. Books v and vi deal with these matters
among others.

This order of topics shows that the main object of Lucr. is
humanitmian, not scientific. He traced human suffering to salse
beliess about the gods and a future life; and science is important
only because it upsets these beliess. In this, os course, he follows
EpicuruS.

55. ino1piam, ‘1 shall endeavour.'

rerum primordia pandam: the second topic is the Atomic
Theory explained in Books i and ii, which shows that divine inter-
position is not necessary, in order to explain the constitution of the
universe.

primordia, ‘atoms'z Lucr. does not use the terms atomi or
indiuidua corpora, which are found in other writers: for a single
atoni, he uses corpus (l. 600). Further, as primordiorum and
primordiis are exeluded by the metre. he regularly uses prz'nczpiorum,
principiis, as gen., dat.‚ and abl. of primordia.

pandam, ⁸1 shall explain.’

56. unde=ex quibus, ‘ out of which.’

natura: personffied, as constantly throughout the poem.

omnis res, ‘all created things’ ι the distinction between res
(called res genitae l. 51 ι) and primordia is fundamental : all res are
composite, being formed of a union of atoms; each atom is one and
indivisible.

57. quoue :et in quae. ⁴ and into which ἐ here and osten in Lucr.
-ue has the sense of -que, the topic being additional, not alternative.
In early Latin generally, the distinction between -ue and -que is not
as marked as that between or and and.

eadem: sem. sing. agreeing with natura. Thus an ambiguity
arises (there are many such in Lucu), because eadem might be the
object of resoluat and agree with perempta ; but the sense shows it
to be fem. sing.
