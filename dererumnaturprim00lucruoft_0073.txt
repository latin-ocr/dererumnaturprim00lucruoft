1-148. (i) Lucretius died, leaving his poem unfinished. The view,
held by Lachmann and Munro, that the earlier books were left in a
completed state, is no longer tenable: they also contain, as will be
shown in the case of Book i, many marks of imperfectiori: see too
p. xvi. It is therefore not surprising that what may be called the
preface (11. 1-148) is in an unsatisfactory condition, so far as the
arrangement of paragraphs is concerned; sor it is probable that the
writer would settle his presace last. Proof of this will be given below:
see esp. notes at ll. 50 and 146. Some rearrangement os these para-
graphs has been suggested. Giussani, sor instance, adopts this order:
1-43; 62<793 lacuna; 136-145; 50—61; 80-135. This seems to me
a more logical order than that given in the Mss. But it is unsafe to
intersere with the text3 for we run the risk os correcting not the
scribes who copied the poem but the author himself.

(ii) All the six books of the De Rerum Natura contain some in-
troductory matter. generally consisting of two parts: (r) a panegyric
on Epicurus: (2) a statement os the matters to be treated os. In this
respect Book i is like the others3 but also, as being the introduction
to the whole poem, it begins with two topics which are not repeated
in any later book: (1) an invocation, to Venus; (2) a dedication,
to Memmius.

The invocation to Venus did not pass uncriticised even in ancient
times, as we shall see (n. tol. 44). Epicurus taught that the gods
take no interest in human affairs. Hence Lucretius, as a follower of
Epicurus, is inconsistent with his own principles, when he asks
Venus to aid him in the writing of his poem. Had he been content
to identify Venus with uoluptas, and to use her name in order to
personify the principle of lise in the universe, it might pass; but he
goes far beyond this. When he feigns to believe (11. 32 foll.) that
Venus and Mars are lovers, he gives his sanction to one of the most
scandalous stories of the gods. There is only one way of accounting
for this remarkable inconsistency. To the ancients—and not to them
only, as Milton's Lycidas will prove-mythology was the very stuff
of poetry3 and Lucretius, though strict elsewhere, was unwilling, at
