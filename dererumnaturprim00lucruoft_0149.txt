NOTES 1 15

867. praeterea=secondly.

corpora. here=res, i.e. trees and plants.

869. amalgerus, i.e. not particles of earth, but miniature trees
and plants.

870. transfer, ‘apply‘ the reasoning ‘to other cases': transfer =
si transferes.

871. A third application ofthe dilemma.

87²· aliemgeniS, i.e. not particles of wood but particles ofsmoke
and flame.

873 is rightly rejected by Giussani: for (ι) it is a mere repetition
of l. 8673 (2) it serves to add a fourth to the previous examples; but
the next paragraph proves that Lucr. limited himself to three
examples.

875-896. Anaxagoras, however, teaches that each thing contains,
not only particles like ilself but also partz'cles qf every other thing.
But this is confuled by the evidence qs our own eyes in each of the
three instances; (ι) animal nutrae‘tiom (α) tlte growtlz of plants‚·
(3) tlte tgnitwn of wood.

Anaxagoras wrote, ἐν παντὶ παντὸς μοῖρα ἔνεστι πλὴν νόου. Mind
alone was not present in matter. Thus every object in the universe
is itselfa kind of world in miniature. This doctrine, which Lucr.
calls ‘a loophole sor evasion,’ is really a cardinal point of the
system, and explained the change of one substance into another,
e.g. of bread into flesh and blood.

876. sibl sumit, ‘avails himself of.’

877. latitare clearly echoes latitandi above: cf. l. 337.

878. mixta, ‘in the mixture)

879. prima in tronto, ‘on the outer sursace.'

881. Note that the three examples which follow are the same as
those given in the last paragraph.

conueniebat, εἰκὸς ῆν, ‘it would be natural,’ if this hypothesis
were true, that corn, which men eat in the shape of bread, should
give, when ground, some indication os blood or some other com-
ponent of the human body; and also that grass and water, the food
and drink of sheep, should give some indication of their milk. But
we see (1. 893) that this is not so.

fruges: see n. to l. 808.
883. aliquid: supply eorum as antecedent of quae.
