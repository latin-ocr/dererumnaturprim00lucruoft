formed from having the coldness os ice. But. as atoms are neither
hot nor cold, it is not strange that they should make both fire and
ice.

¹182-802. The Stoz'cs wrongly teach that tlte four elements are
transmund in a regular series into one anollleoe but transmutation
ostlzis kind means destruction and not creation of anytln'ng. These
changing elements must themselves he formed ιγ’ unchangeable atoms ,
and these atoms, by change of arrangement and motion, can produce
all the variety of matter.

Luer. has now done with Empedocles and assails the theory
already denounced in ll. 763-769. The form os this theory which he
selects is the ὁδὸς ἅνω κάτω of Heracleitus as developed by the
Stoics‚ ‘the ascending and descending series' in which the four
elements pass into one another. To this hypothesis he opposes the
argument which he has used already against the fire of Heracleitus.

782. quin etiam, ‘still further': Giussani renders ‘still worse’:
and there is no doubt that Lucr.‚ who rejected the theory os Em-
pedocles. that res are formed by the mixture of four elements, was
even more opposed to the Stoic theory that one element is trans-
sormed into another.

repetunt a, ‘they start with...’: ‘they' are the Stoics: cf. l. 655.

783 faciunt, ‘maintain’: cs. 1. 692. Cicero osten uses, of a
philosophie tenet, placet governing a dat.

784. hnbrem=aquam.

785. retro, ‘in reverse order.’

787. mter fle mutare: in phrases of this type, Latin idiom dis«
penses with se as object of the verb: e. g. pueri inter se amant (the
boys love one another).

788. mundi :caeli.

This theory is stated by the Stoic Balbus in Cic. De JV. De. ii 84
cum quattuor genera sint corporum, uiczksitudz'ne eorum mundi (the
world) continuata natura est; nam ex terra aqua, ex aqua oritur aer,
ex aere aether (=t'gm's) ,· abinde retrorsum uicissim ex aetlzere aer,
inde aqna, ex aqua terra infima: sic naturis iis, ex quibus omnia
constant, sursus deorsus, ultro citro commeantibus mundi partium
coniunctio continetur. And the Academic Cotta refutes the theory
by using the same argument as Luem: l.l. iii 3¹ omnia haec tum
intereunt. cum in naturam aliam conuertuntur,· quod fit, cum terra
