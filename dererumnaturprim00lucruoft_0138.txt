104 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

698. uanum, ‘untrue': here, as often, an exact synonym of
falsum.

699. quo, ‘to what standard': cf. 1. 4²4·

700. qui: abl.

701. tonat, ‘abolish‚’ i.e. ⁴ deny the existence of....'

70²· ardoris naturamzardorem : see n. to 1. 419.

703. esse relinquat, ‘admit the existence of...’: for the sense of
relinquere, cs. l. 515.

705—733. There z's no trulla in tlze view tlzat any one of the four
elem-eun, fire, air, earth, and waler, is the primary substance. These
are equally far from tlze trum, wlzo couplet air witkfire ον earlh wilh
water, ον who maintain tlzat all thesaur elements are primary. T he
clziqfclzampz'on ostile last view is Empedocles, the greatest glory of the
famous island of Sicily, and a poet almost divine.

705, 706 repeat 635, 636, differing only in the last word.

707. aera: this was the ἀρχή adopted by Anaximenes, as water
(umorem) had been adopted by Thales (13.c. 64o-5 50). Lucr. inverts
the historica] order of the three philosophers.

7¹0· rerum naturas=res. uertier: see n. to 1. 207.

712. adde=and also: again iii 1037. Y

conduplicant p. r., ‘take two elements for their basis of matter.'

7¹4· rebus, ‘elements.’

7 ι 5 amma. is an alias for aere, imbri for aqua.

710. quorum goes with cum primis: others maintained this theory
as well as Empedocles.

Empedocles of Agrigentum (b. 500 B.C.) wrote two scientific
poems, Περὶ Φύσεως and Καθαρμοί, of which nearly 400 verses are
extant; and Lucr. here expresses his gratitude to one who had
expounded in hexameter verse a theory not differing widely srorn his
own. He plainly ranked him high among the graues Graii qm· uera
requirunt.

717. triquetris: so Horace (Sat. ii 6, 55) calls Sicily, whose real
name is inadmissible in dactylic verse, triquelra tellus. virgil takes
refuge in Trinacria, Ovid in Trinacris.

terrarum oris is no more than finibus: again 1. 7² 1.

719. uirus, ‘the brine.’

720. ang-usto fretu rapidum, ‘racing in its narrow channel‚’ i.e.
the Straits of Messina.
