INTRODUCTION xix

of these epithets. But Lucretius, while he shirked no
stumbling-bloeks, does not confine himself to the dry
bones of his subject: he 'touches it all '—t0 use his own
phrase—‘ with the charm of the Muses! And so Fitz-
Gerald wrote of him: ‘I venerate the earnestness of the
man, and the power with which he makes some music
from his hardest Atoms.'

Whether or not he was ill-advised in his choice of a
subject, his poem will continue to find readers as long
as Latin is read at all. The greatness is in the man rather
than in the theme. In the Atomic Theory there is much
that is striking to the imagination; but after all it is the
personality of Lucretius that makes his work a possession
for ever—his unfailing enthusiasm, his perfect sincerity,
his noble sadness, his poetic genius. Throughout the poem,
and not least in the First Book, there are long passages
where nothing is needed, and nothing is given, but orderly
statement and appropriate argument—passages where,
as Manilius says of his astronomy,

Ornari res ipsa negat, contenta doceril.

But when the occasion comes and Lueretius lets himself
go, he can rise to the level of the great Greeks. No poet
has in a higher degree the power to be at once simple and
sublime. Thus when he wishes to say that primitive man
assigned to his gods a dwelling in the sky, this is how he
says it:

In caeloque deum sedes et templa locarunt,

Per caelum uolui quia nox et luna uidetur,

Luna, dies et nox et noctis signa seuera,

N octiuagaeque faces caeli flammaeque uolantes,

Nubila, sol, imbres, nix, uenti, fulmina, grando,

Et rapidi fremitus et murmura magna minarum?

To match such noble music as this, one must go back to
Homer and to Pindar, or to the Book of Job itself.
