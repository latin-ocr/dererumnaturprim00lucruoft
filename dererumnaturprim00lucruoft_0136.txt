102 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

669. But we know already that out of nothing nothing can be pro-
duced.

670. ‘For, whenever a thing changes and quits its proper limits,
at once this change is the death of that which was before’: i.e. a
thing is what it is in virtue of certain characteristics (fines) which
make it what it is: if it loses these characteristics, it ceases to exist.

Lucr. evidently attaches great importance to this dogma which he
repeats thrice (l. 792, ii 753, iii 519). No doubt he found it in
Epicurus. It states the main result of the Eleatic philosophy, and
denies the transformation theories of the Ionic philosophers‚ who
believed that the ἀρχή or primary substance of matter could be trans-
torrned, e.g. that tire might be the ἀρχή and yet could, by trans-

formation‚ produce water. The Eleatics asserted the immutability of
substance.

672. superare=superessez cf. l. 579.

ollis refers either to zgrnz‘s (1. 666), or to quaecumque creantur

atoms depart and some others are added, in each case.

678. corpora=res, and are quite different from corpora in ll. 675,

679. Lucr. is indifferent to such ambiguities, but he would probably
have avoided them in writing prose. ’

679. ignea is the predicate.

680. nil referret, ‘it would make no differencc’ ι cf. Ι. 965.
quaedam, ‘some atoms.’

683. omnimodis, adv„ belongs to soret.

684. itast, ‘the fact is this.'

686. mutant naturam, ‘change the thing they make’: sor this
sense of natura, cf. l. 457.

Do no'. impute to Lucr. the statement that atoms change their
nature: cf. 1. 676.

687. simulata = similia.
688. praeterea = alii, ‘ other.
