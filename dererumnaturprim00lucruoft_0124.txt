90 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

514. corpore has not its technical sense here: transl. ‘mass’

515. ‘ Unless you admit that the substance which bounds the void,
is <itsels> free from void.’

cohibet does not mean ‘ imprisons,' but has here the sense of finire
(Ι. 1004) or dissaepz're (l. 100 5): the meaning is that, where void leaves
off, body begins.

516. materiai concilium is the organised sum of atoms in a res.

517. inane rerum, ‘the void belonging to created things’: that
all res contain inane was shown ll. 346 soll. This phrase does not
occur again and has been suspected.

518, 519. Two disconcerting lines. We expect Lucr. to say:
‘Therefore atoms are solid'3 what he does say is: ‘Therefore atoms
may be indestructible.' Giussani ejects the lines, saying truly that
they anticipate what is said in ll. 538, 539.

519. cetera, i.e. iron, rocks, gold etc. (11. 490 foll.), which all
contain void and therefore can be broken up.

520—527. Another obscure passage. It appears at first sight to be
a third argument for soliditas. But 1. 528 does not begin with the
usual signpost, the praeterea or denique which tells us that a new
argument begins there. Therefore it seems better to explain that
Lucr. begins with tum porro his first argument sor aeternitas, and
that these lines are merely introductory to that. But the course of
reasoning is confused and misleading.

520. uocaret, retained by Lachmann, is the older spelling of
uacaret. But 1 have a suspicion that inane uocamus of l. 507 and
elsewhere may be the cause of the spelling given here by Q.

521. omne, ‘the universe’: τὸ πᾶν of Epicurus.

certa, ὡρισμένα, ‘definite,' i.e. of limited dimensions.

522. tenerent, ‘they occupy’: the mood is due to attraction of
the preceding subjunctive.

52 3. omne quod. est. spatium=0mne‚ ‘the universe’: see n. to

524. ‘Therefore assuredly body is marked off from void <and
void from body> in alternate layers.’

alternis, adv„ shows that after corpus inam' we must understand
et inane corpore.

52 5. nauiter (adv. of nauus) = prorsus.
The subject of the verb is omne quod est spatium understood.
