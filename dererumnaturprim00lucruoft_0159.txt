NOTES 125

1012-1013. ‘Or else that one of the two components‚ in case the
other does not bound it, stretches nevertheless to infinity by
itself.'

At this point some verses have been lost, but the text of Epicurus
throws light upon the lost passage. He writes (Usener l.l. p. 7) καὶ
τῷ πλήθει τῶν σωμάτων ἄπειρόν ἐστι τὸ πᾶν καὶ τῷ μεγέθει τοῦ κενοῦ.
εἴ τε ’γὰρ ἤν τὸ κενὸν ἄπειρον τὰ δέ σώματα ὡρισμένα, οὐδαμοῦ ἂν
ἔμενε τὰ, σώματα. ἀλλ’ ἐφέρετο κατὰ. τὸ ἄπειρον κενὸν διεσπαρμένα·...
εἴ τε τὸ κενὸν ἦν ὡρισμένον, οὒκ ἂν εἶχε τὰ ἄπειρα. σώματα ὅπου
ἐνέστη. ‘The universe is infinite both by reason of the multitude of
atoms and the extent of void. For, if void were infinite and atonis
finite, the atoms would not have stayed anywhere but would have
been dispersed in their course through the infinite void. Again,1's
void were limited, tlte infinite number cy* atoms would not have had
any place wherein to be.’

The words printed in italics give the substance of what has been
lost in the text of Lucr. There is a difference of order. because
Lucr. took second the hypothesis of infinite space and limited atoms;
whereas the hypothesis of limited space and infinite atoms, which
has disappeared from the text os Lucr.‚ comes second in Epicurus.

'l'he existence ofthis lacuna, early suspected, was proved by Madvig
(Opust. Acad. pp. 254 soll.) in 1832, eighteen years before the publi-
cation of Lachmann's edition.

1014—1051. <But tlzis is impossible. Body and void must eaclc
be infinite. For (1) if space were limited and atoms infinite, the atoms
could not be contained in space,· (2) ιγ space were infinite, and the
number of atoms limited> , then our world with its inhabitants, and
the gods outside our world, would instanlly disappear: indeed, none
of these things would ever have been formed. The formation of our
world was not due to design: it is due solely to tlze constant movement
through infinite time osan unlz'mited number of atoms. T lze pre-
servation also osa world would be impossible, ιγ atoms were limited in
number. Freslt atoms may pour infor a time and give new lzse to an
old world ; but tlzat renewal will not last for ever.

1014. The three main divisions of our world (see n. to l. 2) would
instantly disappear. All the worlds in the universe would be
affected in the same way3 but Lucr. purposely limits his view: see
n. to l. 988.
