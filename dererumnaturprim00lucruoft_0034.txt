at Milan. He published his edition of Lucretius in 18961
and followed it up with his Note Luoreziane in 1899; the
second book is a reply to the critics of the first. He died
at Milan in 1900.

Giussani's work differs in many ways from that os
Bernays. Though never clumsy or pedantic, he takes
no pains about the presentation of his matter and has
no power to state an argument concisely. His com-
mentary, with the preliminary volume of essays, and
the supplementary volume of answers to crities, runs to
such a length that it is not likely ever to be translated
into English. He was too ready to resort to transpositions
of the text. He can hardly be called a good Latin scholar:
he sometimes mistook the meaning of words and even
disfigured his text by false quantities. And yet, in spite
of these deficiencies‚ it may be said that he revolutionised
the study of Lucretius. He did this by turning the
searehlight of a wonderfully acute intelleet upon all the
places where the sequence of thought had not been made
clear by previous interpreters; and he succeeded again
and again where others had failed: uiuida uis animi
peruicit. The ingenious are too apt to discover mare's-
nests; but it seems to me that Giussani, for all his
wonderful ingenuity, found few such. In appreciation of
Lucretius, either as reasoner or as poet, he is inferior to
none of the commentators‚ and his name will not be
forgotten while the De Rerum Natura is studied.
