THE LEYDEN MANUSCRIPTS OF LUCRETIUS

The text of Lucretius depends mainly upon two manu-
scripts which are now in the University Library of Leyden.
Both belonged at one time to Isaac Vossius, a Dutch
scholar who settled in England and died as a prebend of
Windsor in 1689. Vossius, who was a native of Leyden,
never published a collation of these manuscripts. When
Vossius died, several learned bodies sought to acquire the
library which contained these and other treasures. Evelyn
wrote to Pepys on August 12, 1689: ‘I wished with all
my heart some brave and noble Maecenas would have
made a present of them to Trinity College in Cambridge ’ς
but the Maecenas was not forthcoming, and this laudable
wish was not realised. Bentley, not yet Master of Trinity
but residing at Oxford as tutor to young Stillingfleet, tried
to secure the collection for the Bodleian: but the negotia-
tions hung fire, and meanwhile the University of Leyden
put money in its purse, stepped in, and carried off the
pnze.

But that once famous centre of learning made little use
of their acquisition. The manuscripts lay on the shelf un—
collated and unknown until 1725, when Havercamp used
them for his edition of Lucretius published in that year.
Havercamp had no inkling os their importance; and even
his report of their readings was incomplete and inaccurate.
But Lachmann has written this editor's epitaph: H aver-
campum omni tempore omnes contempserunt. Their true
value was revealed by Lachmann himself in his edition
