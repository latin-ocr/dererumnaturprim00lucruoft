44 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

governed Bithynia as propraetor, and one of his staff was Catullus,
so that he was connected with both the great poets os his time.
Catullus speaks of him with dislike (ιο and 28); Cicero records
that he was skilled in Greek literature but contemptuous of Latin
(Brutus 247). His political career was not creditable or consistent.
Why Lucr. dedicated the poem to him, we do not know: with no
reference to this case, L. Stephen (Hours in a Library ii 146)
speaks of ⁴ that kind of delusion which osten leads a mere literary ob·
server to see a losty intention in the schemes osa selfish politician.’

tn, dea: Venus appears on coins of the Memmii; they seem to
have taken her sor their patron goddess.

28. quo magis: the favour of Venus for Memmius is an addi-
tional reason why she should add grace and charin to the poem and
make it immortal.

da dictis ε Virgil would prefer dictis da: the first 1. os the Aeneid
ends with Troiae qui primus ab oris. not qui Troiae cet-2 see n. to
1. 3.

29· moenera mumai: ‘works of war' preserves the alliteration‘
This gen. in -αἰ is very common in Lucr.: see p xxiii: for a dat. in
ai, see n. to 1. 453. ·

30. omnis belongs to maria as much as to terras.

3¹· tranquilla pace, ‘with peace and quiet.'

33 soll. In the power of vivid description no poet has ever sur-
passed Lucr.: one might suppose he was here following a picture or ,
marble group, but he needed nothing of the kind to stir his imagi·
nation. The passage is imitated by Byron, Ckz'lde Harold iv 51.

35. ita, ‘sO,’ in the way described, lying on the lap of Venus.

suspiciens, ‘looking up‚’ into the face of the goddessz cf. ii ¹039
suspicere in caeli ...lucida templa.

tereti, ‘shapely’: an epithet of an object that is both long and
round.

reposta: reposita: this contractiori is common, but postus for
positus is found only in Lucr.: cf. Ovid Fast. ii 63 (to Augustus)
templorum positor, templorum sancte repostor.

36. pascit...uisus, ἑστιᾷ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς, ⁶ feasts his eyeS.’

amore is best taken with auidos:

inhians, ‘with open mouth': Munro quotes Esdras i 4, 31 ‘The
king gaped and gazed upon her with open mouth.'
