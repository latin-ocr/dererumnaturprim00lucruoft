NOTES 103

689. tactus represents ‘sense of touch‘ : see n. to l. 303.

All senses are considered as forms of touch. Lucr. explains (iv 46
soll.) that all res are continually discharging films (simulacra,=
corpora os l. 688) from their sursace; these films strike upon our
organs of sense and so produce sensation. But atoms‚ because they
contain no void, are incapable os discharging films.

eoo-704. T lte dogma that nothing exists except firc is mere folly,
and defies the evidence qs our semes. T lze senses are our only test ‘U‘
trulh, and they tell us osthe existence of other things just as clearly.
Why should fire be chosen out in preference to any otherperceptihle
thing?

Having attacked Heracleitus sor his theory of the comp =sition of
matter, Luer. now attacks his theory os perception, and charges him
with inconsistency.

691. m numero rerum=in rebus: ef. l. 270. The repetition, re.
rem, rerum, is characteristic.

constare is either :en-e, or means ‘ remains unchanged‚'as inl. 165.

692. facit: cf. l. 655.

perdelirum, ‘sheer madness’: not found elsewhere.

693. Heracleitus accepts the evidence of the senses in the case of
fire, but rejects it in the case of all other qualities perceptible to the
senses z thus he is inconsistent.

ab sensibus, ‘while desending the senses’ in the case of fite: cf.
Cic. De lnuent. i 4 a mendacio contra uerum stare (to defend salse-
hood against truth) : this use of ab is commonest in the language of
the law-courts.

694. Following Epicurus. Lucr. repeatedly asserts that the senses
are the only court os appeal‚ and sensation the only guarantee of
reality: es. ll. 423 soll„ and esp. iv 379—521. For Epicurus, cf.
Usener l. l. p. 5 κατὰ τὰς αἰσθήσεις δεῖ πάντα. τηρεῖν; Cic. De Fin.
i 22 (of Epicurus) iudicia rerum in sensibus ponit.

But Heracleitus distrusted sense-knowledge z he said, κακοὶ μάρτυ-
ρες ἀνθρώποισι ὀφθαλμοὶ καὶ ὦτα, and again, διὰ, τούτων (Le. the
senses) ’γνῶσις ἀνθρώποισιν ἀγνωσίη.

unde...pendent‚ ‘on which all our beliefs depend’: unde=a
quibus.

696. cog-noscere uere, ‘have a true perception of....·

697. cetera: supply sensus cognoscere uere.
