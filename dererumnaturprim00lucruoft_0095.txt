NOTES 61

146-148 are repeated in three other Books‚ near the beginning of
each (ii 59, iii 91, vi 39). Any of these passages will show that Lucr.
did not write the lines sor Book i, but inserted them here as an
after-thought. For elsewhere he begins by comparing mankind to
children srightened by the dark, so that the mention of the sun,
relevant there, is not really relevant here.

This is important, as a clear case os a practice which is probably
common throughout the poem: see Index under ‘insertions.‘

146. terrorem refers back to terrificet, l. ¹33·

tenebras, as much as terrorem, belongs to animi.

147. lucida tela. (uei, ⁴ the shining arrows of the light,’ a noble
synonym sor radii solis.

148. species, ‘the outward aspect,' ratio, ‘the hidden law’ os
Nature: naturae ratio = φυσιολογία.

¹49· cuius refers to ratio: it scans here as a pyrrhic (ν ν)ε so cui
is sometimes a pyrrhic in verse.

lunc, ‘from what follows.’ i.e. from the following principle.

150. nul-lam rem e mlo gigni: so Epicurus begins his outline os
the system addressed to Herodotus: οὐδὲν ’γίνεται ἐκ τοῦ μὴ ὄντος,
every thing is produced from some previously existing matter. This
rules out the arbitrary creation of things out of nothing by the gods.
In a more general and abstract form, this principle implies that the
qualities and limits osan effect are invariably determined by its
cause. See n. to l. ¹60.

diuinitus, ‘by divine power’: cf. ll. 154, 158. From the scientific
point of view this word is unnecessary and irrelevant. But the main
object of Lucr. is not scientifie: he values science only as a means
ofdisproving current theology. See n. to l. 54, and ll. 93¹ foll.

151· quippe, ‘sor.’

lta, ‘in the way we see.'

continet, ‘paralyses.'

152. multa, sc. opera, to be taken from operum below: sor the
constr.. cs. l. 16.

153. causas: cs. vi 54 ignorantia causarum conferre deorum
fagit ad imperium res et concedere regnum. The quotation shows
that uidere = intellegere.

154. ac...rentur, ‘and which they suppose...’ ι the second of two
relatives is often omitted in Latin: see n. to l. 721.
