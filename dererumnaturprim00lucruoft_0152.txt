118 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

serve here, and added these six lines: indeed ll. 919, 9²0 would
hardly be intelligible without the full explanation given in Book ii.
For similar insertions, see nn. to ll. 132, 146, 196, 205.

915. quaecumque, ‘all the processes which... .'

rebus apertis, ‘visible things,’ identical with res genitae of
1. 511.

916. neri, ‘take place?

quin fingas, ‘without your imagining....’

918. pereunt, ‘are destroyed‚’ i.e. cease to be primordia at all.

919-920 are almost identical with ii 976, 977.

For the purpose of argument, it would be enough to say, ridere
et flere debebunt; but the detail is added, to make the conclusion
more grotesque.

921—950. Listen to what remaz‘tzs. Dark as tlze subject is, Ifind
joy in treating of matters wlzzclz no poet lzas ever touched before. I
deserve fame, because mankznd will derz've relies and freedom from
my labours, and also because of my poelry. As a drauglzt of bz'ller
medicine is made palalable to children by smearing lzoney on tlze rim
of tlze cup, so l try to make this obscure philosophy altractt've by
investing it with tlte charm quoelry.

Lucr. has now ended the polemical part of his poem (ll. 635-920);
and here, before returning to the exposition of his own system, he
refreshes the reader with these beautiful verses.

921. nunc age: see n. tol. 265.

quod superest, ‘what remains,’ is the object of the imperatives.

clarius, ‘more distinctly’: the word is evidently referred to by
obscura below.

9²²· animi: see n. to l. 136.

obscura: the plur. implies that the whole system, and not merely
the part of it which comes next, is abstruse.

9²3· thyrso=magic wand: desire of praise acts on the poet’s
mind as the thyrsus acts on the votary of Bacchus: for the meta-
phorical use, cf. Ovid Trist. iv 1, 43 mota calent uiridi mea pectora
thyrso (= poetic inspiration).

925. instinctus, ‘inspired.’

mento uigenu, ‘with eager thought)

Lucr. draws a true portrait os himself here.

926—950 are repeated almost exactly as an exordium to Book iv
