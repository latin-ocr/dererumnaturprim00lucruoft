NOTES 43

22. dias: the adj. is used thrice by Lucr. with three different
meanings: ‘brighi' here3 ii 172 dia (zdiuz'na) uolupla5; v 1387
otia dia (rest beneath the open sky): cf. sub dz'uo.

luminis oras, ‘realm of light‚’ i.e. this world, the antenatal state
being one os darkness.

oras, lit. ‘ borders‘; but Lucr., and other writers, use it often to
denote the space contained between the borders.

23. laetum: cf. 1. 14: the epithet suits animals as well as vege-

tables and may be applied metaphorically to a poem.
24. scribendis uersibus: dat. of work contemplated.

esse, having no emphasis, would not be tolerated at the end os
the verse by the Augustan poets: it is their regular practice to
pack away the words that matter least in the middle os the verse.
But Lucr. often has esse, sunt ete. in emphatic positions.

25. de rerum natura, ‘concerning the nature of things': here
the phrase: natural science. Περὶ Φύσεως was the title of many
philosophical works written in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. By
φύσις those early enquirers meant ‘the primary substance) later
called ἀρχή; but a different meaning appears in the title os the
poem of Empedocles (b. 500 B.C.)‚ the ti‘eatise of EpicuruS, and this
poem of Lucretius. Lucr. means by it one of the three divisions of
philosophy. ‘ Physics' or natural science, the other two being Ethics
and Logic. This is the subject of his p‹›ein; his ethical discussions
are only incidental; and to Logic he, like his master, paid little
attention.

pangere, ‘to pen’: used first by Ennius of poetical composition,
and later even in prose: cf. Cic. ad Fam. xvi ¹8, 3 an pangis
aliquid Sophocleum ? ; Tac. A nn. xiv 16 pangendi facultas (skill in
writing verse). [t is used of writing prose as well as verse.

26. Memmiadae nostro, ‘sor our son os the Memmii': the
patronymic is invented to serve {or lllemmio which the metre will
not admit: so Lucr. admits Scipio into his poem under the name of
Scipiadas (iii ¹034)ss in each case the patronymie has a more im-
posing sound, but the poet has made a virtue of necessity. The
vocative, Alemmi, which offers no metrical difficulty, he uses osten,

Gaius Memmius wasa Roman noble and an active politician. As
praetor in 58 B.C. he tried to annul the democratic laws passed by

Caesar as consul in the previous year (Suet. lul. 20); in 57 he
