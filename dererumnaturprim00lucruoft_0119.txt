NOTES 85

453, 454. The second l. was expelled from the text by Lachmann
sor two reasons: (ι) the two datives ought to be genitives; (2) nouns
formed like intactus are used only in the abl. sing-t thus there is a
word iniussu, but the nom. iniussus is never found. The second
objection is not fatal: Lucr. might have made and used the word
intaclus to represent ἀνάφεια (intangibility); and it is noticeable
that Epicurus gives ἀντιτυπία (impenetrability) as a property osbody,
and εἶξις (yieltling) as a property of void. The real difficulty is that,
is we accept l. 454, we must admit in l. 453 a dative in -ᾱῑ, a form
which is never found in the extant literature. I believe therefore
that the l. should be ejected srorn the text.

45 5. paupertas etc. should be accusatives: the irregularity is rare
in Latin but seems natural enough.

Metre has prevented Lucr. from arranging his pairs symmetrically :
is he had written libertas diuitiaeque, lpaupcrlas‚ the nouns would
be in the right order, but the —que would spoil the arrangement.

456. cetera-abituque, ‘and all other things which may come
and go without injury to the thing itself’: e.g. a man, whether a
slave or free, is still a man.

457. natura here, and in l. 687, denotes the res per se, the sub-
stance to which the accidents belong.

458. ut par est, *as it is right we should': i.e. we use the word
euentum in its natural sense os ‘occurrencesss

459. item: like other euentu, time is not an essential part of the
existence os things or persons, but, unlike them, is conceivable in
relation, not to corpora but to their euentu: it is an euentum euent-
orum.

It is remarkable that Lucr., while saying what time is not, does
not tell us what it is. But the definition of Epicurus is as follows—-
σύμπτωμα συμπτωμάτων παρεπόμενον πάθεσι καὶ ἀπαθείαις καὶ κινήσεσι
καὶ μοναῖς (Usener l. l. p. 126): and the latter part os the definition
is reproduced by Lucr.

rebus ab ipsis, ‘simply from occurrences': these are called res
gestae below.

460. consequitur sensus, ‘our feeling grasps,’ i.e. we realise.
sensus here is mental perception: one might expect ratio to be used
instead.

in aeuo, ‘in the past)
