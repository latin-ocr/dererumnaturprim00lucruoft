before either multis or multae, thus denying to Lucretius
either ingenium or ars. The insertion of a negative, how-
ever, is a bold step in any case where the text is intelligible
without it. That Cicero should deny ingenium to Lucretius
is inconceivable; if he had denied him ars, reasons could,
I think, be given for such an opinion. But it is wiser to
leave the text alone and believe that the brothers found
both ingenium and ars in the poem. Stin it is difficult to
understand why Cicero was not more enthusiastic in its
praise, and why there is not a single mention of Lucretius
in the long series of philosophical works which Cicero
poured forth ten years after the poet's deathl.

So meagre and uncertain are the details which we learn
from the writers oi antiquity about the personal history
of Lueretius2. He is mentioned occasionally by later
poets and prose-writers, sometimes quoted and sometimes
criticised ς but no particulars of his life or death are any-
where else recorded. It is possible to add something to
tradition from the internal evidence os his poem.

In the first place, it is fairly certain that Lucretius was
a Roman of good family and fortune. His gentile name
is that of an ancient patrician house; and the tone which
he uses to Memmius, a man oi high rank and a person os
importance in his day, points to the same conclusion: he
speaks as an earnest schoolmaster might speak to a pupi]

¹ There are tolerably certain allusions to Lucretius in
Cicero: see note to l. 74. The most explicit of these occurs in
Tuso. Disp. i 48 soleo saepe mirari nonnullorum insolentiam
philosophorum, qui naturae cognitionem admirantur, eiusque
inuentori et principi gratias exultantes agunt, euinque uenerantur
ut deum: liberatos enim se per eum dicunt grauissimis dominis,
terrore sempiterno et diurno ac nocturno metu. Lucretius uses
such language repeatedly of Epicurus.

2 The manuscript life discovered by Dr John Masson in the
British Museum in 1894 does contain some new details ; but
the source from which they were drawn is unknown, which
makes one hesitate to attach importance to them.
