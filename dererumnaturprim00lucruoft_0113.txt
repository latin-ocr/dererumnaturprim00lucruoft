NOTES 79

Lucr. here makes a concession to his antagonist: the space thus
created will be filled by εἰη but, he goes on. the process must take
time, and, until it is complete, there is void between the bodies.

The explanation os motion here resuted was stated above, ll. 372-
376·

387. porro, ‘now.'

circum celerantibus, ‘swist—circling.'

388. uno tempore, ‘in one moment!

389. primum quemque, τὸν ἀεὶ πρῶτον, ‘first one spot and then
another!

39²· ⁴ Supposes that this < moving apart > takes place thembecause
the air contracts ’ and so makes room sor thern.

Note that this is a second false explanation of motion.

id fieri = corpora dissilire.

aer is the air outside the two bodies.

393, 394. ‘He is mistakem for at that moment a void is formed
<between the bodies > which did not exist before3 and a space which
was void before <in the air outside the bodies> is filled up.’

tum, i.e. at the moment of separation.

395. tan ratione, ‘in the manner described': cs. l. 1081.

denserier: for the form, see n. to l. ²07·

396. si iam and ut iam are used with the pres. subj. to state a
hypothesis provisionally‚ sor the sake of argument: see Madvig on
Cic. De Fin. iv 66. Cf. l. 968.

397. trahere, ‘to withdraw‚' intrans.

898-417. There are many other prooft of the existence qs Voz'd;
but these are enough, zf you prove an earnes! disczple. [J you slmw
slackness, I have an mdless store of argumenls which out· whole
lives would not exhaust.

398. quapropter, impossible in 1. 334, is in place here, after the
proofs have been given.

causando, ‘ by raising objections.¹

multa. goes with moreris: cf. v 91 ne lc in promissis plura
moremur.

399. ln rebus: see n. tol. 330.

400. praeterea: alid.

40¹· fldem conradere, ‘to serape together evidence’; the verb
seems contemptuous.
