xvi IN TRODUCTION

Thus it will be seen that Lucretius begins by laying
down the first principles of the atomio philosophy, and
then discusses in his last four books some special applica-
tions of that doctrine. The poet’s aim throughout is
practieal and moral rather than scientifi01. Shelley him-
self was not a more eager humanitarian than Lucretius.
His main object, as he asserts more than once, is to free
the soul of man from superstitious fears by displaying the
aspect and the laws of nature: and this is why he argues
with such passionate earnestness against the immortality
of the soul and the interference of the gods in human
affairs. He values his atomic theory not so much for its
truth, but because it gives, or professes to give, a natural
explanation of phenomena generally attributed to super-
natural agency. It appears that Lucretius lived long
enough to complete in outline the task he had set before
himself ; but not one of the six books is complete and
finished in detail.

Let us briefly examine the F irst Book from this point
os view. (1) The noble prelude, so famous for its strength
and beauty, has not escaped criticism with regard to the
arrangement of its paragraphs2. (2) Later in the book
there is a passage of nearly a hundred lines³ where the
course of the argument remains confused and unsatis-
factory after all the labours of a generation of commen-
tators. (3) There are a number of short passages hardly
intelligible where they stand, of which the explanation
follows in a different part of the poem. The inference to
be drawn from this is not doubtful. While Lucretius was
engaged upon the later parts of his work, it often struck
him that the argument in hand might serve in an earlier
discussion; whereupon he turned back and hastily in-
serted some provisional lines in his manuscript. In the
