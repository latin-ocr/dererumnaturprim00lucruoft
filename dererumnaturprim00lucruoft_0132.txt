98 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

minimam (rem supplied from rerum)=paruissimam rem: if
Lucr. had meant the part of the atom, he would have written
minimum.

quid escit. would be quid intererit in prose: esce is an inceptive
sorm ossum, so that its present can be future in meaning.

620. nil erit. ut distet: lit. ‘it will turn out that there is no
difference': a periphrasis for nil distabit.

funditus, ‘absolutely.'
622. The absurdity depends on the assumption, that all infinites

are equal. To Lucr. this is so obvious, that he does not even state
it3 Newton corrects him, saying that ‘infinites are neither equal
nor unequal, nor have any certain difference or proportion one to

another-⁹
623. quod, ‘but': cf. l. 82: if it were governed by reclamat, cuz'

would be required.
ratio uera, ‘logic’: cf. 11. 51, 498: in each place the sense is

different.
625. iam means ‘when you corne to them.’
exstent, = sint.
627. ina quoque, ‘the atoms also ’ as well as their parts.
solida atque aeterna: here Lucr. returns to the two qualities of

which he spoke in l. 500.

628. denique, ‘thirdly‚' introduces a third proof that the atom
must have parts.

minimas in partis, i.e. into the cacumina of the atom ε res are
broken up into atoms; but there the breaking stops.

630. eadem: sem. sing. : ‘Nature too would no longer be able to
make any new thing out of those parts.'

632. ea, ‘those properties.'

genitalis = ut res gzgnerc possit.

633. The motion ofatoms, their ‘entanglements, weights‚ blows,
and clashings' are discussed in Book ii.

634. motUS, placed last, is the emphatic word. All creationis
due to the inherent motion by which the atoni swerves from the
perpendicular, as described in Book ii 216 soll. Aristotle had laid
down that a thing without parts cannot have inherent motion; and
for this reason, apparently, Epicurus determined that his atoms,
though indivisible, must have parts.
