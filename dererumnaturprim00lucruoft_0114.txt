80 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

402. uestigia, ‘footprints,' i.e. outlines, hintsz this word sug-
gested the simile which follows.

sagaci: see n. tol. 50.

403. sunt: for the emphatic position, see n. to l. ²4·

tute, not tute'.

404. ferai, not ferarum of recent edd.. is required: Lucr. has
montiuagum genus ferarum (ii 597, 1081); and the epithet is quite
unsuitable to a pack of hounds which are kept in order by the
huntsman till they find, and then run straight upon the scent.

405. naribus, ‘by scent.¹

quietes, ‘testing-place,' ‘lain'

407. alid ex alio: see n. to 1. 263.

uidere, ‘to understand)

408· caecas latebras, ‘dark corners.’

409. insinuare: here intrans.

protrahere: Lucr. is still thinking of his simile and compares the
search for truth to the drawing of a badger from its earth.

4¹0· pigraris: contraction ofpz'grauerz's.

ab re, ‘from the matter in hand.'

411. de plano, ‘offhand‚’ with no pomp and circumstance: a
legal phrase: the magistrate might speak either pro tribunali, ‘from
the judgment-seat,’ or de plano, ‘from the level ground’ ; hence the
latter comes to mean ‘in plain terms.'

It is very characteristic of Lucr. that he proposes to treat the
reluctance of his pupil by a still larger dose of the same medicine.

412. fontibu’ magnis: the works of Epicurus, the chartae which
are praised in iii 10.

413. suauis, ‘musical.'

diti, ‘richly stored.'

4¹4· tarda: sem. sing: Lucr. is indifferent to the ambiguity.

415. uitai claustra, ‘the sortress of life‚' which is besieged by
old age and death: this fine metaphor is repeated in iii 396.

416. te, ‘topic’: of the existence of void, for example, Lucr.
says that he could go on adding proof to proof, until both he and
Memmius died of old age.

uersibus, ‘in my poem.'

418—448. T lze universe consists of two substances only: (ι) body,
the existence of wlziclz is proved by our seuseu (2) void, tlte existence
