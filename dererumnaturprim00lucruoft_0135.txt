N OTES 101

admixtum rebus: see n. tol. 369. The Stoics admitted the
existence of void outside the world, but denied void within it.

657. nasci, ‘arise’z so Munro sor musae and mu of MSS.= the
word came last on p. 27 of the archetype and was therefore specially
liable to injury: see n. to 1. 554.

musac is kept by Ernout and explained by a reference to Diog.
Laert. ix 1, 12, where it is said that some called Heracleitus's book
by this name. But neither this passage, nor Plato Sepla. '²4² D,
proves that Μοῦσαι was the recognised title of the work. Also, it
seems impossible that cernunt here should have a subject different
from that ossaciant above and the following verbs.

Laehmann's note shows that he anticipated and rejected this
explanation.

658, 659 have been transposed 1n the text: Ι feel that 659 ex-
presses a result rather than a cause.

658. ardua...uia1, ‘the steep road‚’ uera uial, ‘the right road 'z
cf. l. 315 strala uiarum.

660. rursum, ‘on the other hand.’

cernunt here refers to cernunt of l. 657.

exempto rebus: see n. to l. 369.

662. mittere, ‘to discharge.’

663. In the view of Lucr., light and heat (uapor) are merely
diffused particles of fite.

665. A second conceivable explanation is now resuted.

alia. ratione, ‘by another process ot reasoning': this belongs to
credunt, not to stingui.

666. ignis, i.e. the particles of fire.

in coetu, i.e. when they meet to make a res, coetus being used in
the sense of concilium: cf. l. 772. For coetus in this sense, cf. 11.
1017, 1026 ete.

Lucr. is applying the technical terms of his own theory to the
theory of Heracleitus.

stingui: not metaphorieal here, as in 1. 486.

eorpus here=naturam, ‘their characteristic' of heat.

667. ‘Yon must know, if they shall not refrain from asserting this
at every point‚’ i.e. is they assert that this takes place invariably.

reparcent = parcent: the subject is the same as that of sacrant iu
l. 655. Some supply zjgnes as subject.
