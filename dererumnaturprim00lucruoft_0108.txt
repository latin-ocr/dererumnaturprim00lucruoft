74 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

dies, ‘time'

324. oculorum acies contenta, ‘exertion of the eyesight.'

326. mare: the acc. after zmpendire is archaic and rare; Lucr.
has acc. after accidere v 608.

nescu, ‘smalh’ ‘fine’: Bentley (Hor. Sat. i 2, ¹²9) quotes this l.
and explains the word as tenui et minutissimis partibus constante.
See Conington's n. to Virg. Georg. iii 175.

327. quoque intempore, ‘at each moment': cf. l. 320.

possis, ‘can one see’: Memmius is not addressed here: this use
of the znd pers. of the pres. subjunctive is constant in Latin.

328. gerit res, ‘ works,' ‘does her business)

The emphatic word here is caecis: Epicurus and Lucr. held that
every change in nature was caused by the movement and com·
bination of invisible particles of matter, called ‘atoms.'

329—369. But aloms are not tlte only factor os the universe: there
is a second factor, which we call ‘voidj T lze existence of void may
be proved in three ways: (1) by the possibility of motion ‚⁶ (2) by the
penetrability os solid bodies ; (3) by the unlike weiglzl of two bodies qs
like size. We must therefore believe llzat void exists.

A special difficulty about ‘void’ must be noticed here. Inane
(κενόν) is used by Lucr., following Epicurus, to denote two different
things: (1) empty space; (2) space, in which bodies rest, properly
called locus (τόπος), or through which bodies move, properly called
spatium (χώρα). In fact, both locus and spatium are sometimes in-
clusive, and sometimes exclusive, of the bodies contained in them:
for the former, cf. l. 523 and see n. to l. 969.

329. corporea...natura=corpore: see n. to l. 419.

stipata, ‘jammed together’x a transl. of the technical term
συμπιλούμενα.

330. est in rebus, ‘is in the number of things‚’ ‘actually exists’:
cf. 11. 270, 488. The words might mean ‘exists inside things‚’ and
have generally been so taken3 but the present purpose of Lucr. is to
prove the existence of void generally ; and the existence of void in
things is not proved by the possibility of motion. See n. to l. 369.

This 1. is echoed in Persius i 1 c curas hominnm! quantum cst in
rebus inane!

331. quod, ‘this fact,' i.e. the existence of void.

332. quaerere, ‘to be at a loss-¹
