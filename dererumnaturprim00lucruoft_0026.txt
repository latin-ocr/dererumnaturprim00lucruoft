metrica] necessity—he coins words like Cato and Ennius
before him. He is excessively fond of alliteration and
assonance, which are so congenial to early Latin and occur
so frequently in Ennius and still more in Plautus: here
again Virgil declined to go to such lengths as his pre-
decessors: the Aeneidis indeed full os alliteration, but the
alliteration is not obtruded. His sentences are often
exceedingly long and rather loosely constructed; he is
indifferent to ambiguities which the Augustan poets
would not have tolerated; and the position of w0rds in
his verse is unlike their practice1. Again his metre, though
much more musical and beautiful than that of Ennius,
is itself wanting in harmony and especially in variety,
when compared with the rich perfection of Virgil's
rh thm.

yThe difficulty of Lucretius, which even the ancients
seltz is due chiefly to the nature of the subject, but partly
also to the inadequacy of the language as an instrument
for expressing abstract ideas. Ennius had been able with
rude vigour to depict the early history of Rome, to lay
down a model of heroic verse for his successors‚ and to
bequeath to them a considerable vocabulary. But the
language was still, as Lucretius thrice over complains³,
a very imperfect instrument for philosophie discussion
or scientific argument. The measure of success which he
attained is astonishing and must have been the reward of
immense labour.

It has often been said that Lucretius was unfortunate
in his choice of a subject ; but one feels that sor him it was
impossible to write on any other. According to Milton,
poetry should be simple, sensuous‚ impassioned; and it
would be difficult for any poem consisting mainly of the
exposition of a philosophical system, to deserve even one
