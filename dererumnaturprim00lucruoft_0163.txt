NOTES 1²9

1058. pondera, ‘heavy bodies,’ such as a house.

sunt, sor sint, is remarkable in oratio obliqua 3 but Munro defends
it by similar examples.

sub terris, i.e. on the lower side of the earth.

sursum: in their struggle towards the centre.

Lucr. is ridiculing the Antipodes in whose existence he disbelieves.

1059. retro posta, ‘upside down.’

1060. ut. refers only to retro posta: reflexions in water do not press
upwards.

nunc, ·actually.’

1061. animalia, ‘living things': distinguished from pondera.

suppa=supina, ‘upside down,' like a fly on the ceiling.

1062. contendunt. ‘they argue)

loca caen inferiora, ‘the part of the sky beneath them?

1065. 1111: nom. pl. masc.: the antipodes.

1066. alternis, ‘turn about.’

tempora. caeli, ‘the seasons' (Munro); but perhaps Giussani is
right in supposing that the reference is still to day and night.

1067. noctes—diebus, ‘spend nights equal in length to our days':
this must be the meaning, but the omission of nostris is surprising.

1068-1075. In the MS.‚ no longer extant, from which all existing
MSS. are derived, the top corner of a leaf was here torn off, so that
the end words of these eight verses are lost. On the other side os
the leaf, the beginnings of eight verses (1094-1101) were also torn
off, and the copyist did not think it worth while to preserve the end
words which he must have found there. This accident proves that
the original MS. had 26 lines to a page.

1068. stemus, ‘for sools': see n. to 1. 641.

¹070- Lucr. repeats what he said in ll. 965, 967.

1071. sl lam: see n. to 1. 396.

1072. consistere, ‘to take up a position)

¹07 3. longe goes with repelli.

1075. per nou medium, ‘and through no-centre': cf. ii 930 ex
non sensibu’ sensus.

1076. ponderibus, ‘to heavy bodies,' as indeed to all corpus of

whatever weight.
motus quacumque feruntur, ‘in whatever direction their motions

tend,' i-e. whether they pass. or not, through the imaginary centre.
