N OTES 81

(ff which is necessary for the position and movement eff bodies. There
is no third substance. For every existing thing is either tangible or
intangible,· but everylhing latqgt'ble is body, and everything intangible
is void. A gain, every exz'stt'ng thing is either active or acted upon (in
which cases it is body), or merely a receptacle (in which case it is voia).
There is therefore no third substance.

Lucr. now returns from his exhortation to Memmius and takes up
the exposition again. For this purpose he translates an extant text
of Epicurus in his Letter to Herodotus: τὸ πᾶν ἐστὶ σώματα καὶ τόπος·
σώματα μὲν γὰρ ὡς ἔστιν, αὑτὴ ἡ αἴσθησις ἐπὶ πάντων μαρτυρεῖ, καθ’
ἢν ἀναγκαῖον τὸ ἄδηλον τῷ λογισμῷ τεκμαίρεσθαι. τόπος δὲ εἰ μὴ
ἦν, ὃν κενὸν καὶ χώραν καὶ ἀναφῆ φύσιν ὀνομάζομεν, οὐκ ἂν εἶχε τὰ
σώματα ὅπου ἦν οὐδὲ δι’ οὗ ἐκινεῖτο (Usener Epicurea p. 6). All this
is closely translated by Lucr. ; and there is no other passage of equal
length in the poem which we can compare with its source in the text
of Epicurus.

This Letter to Herodotus, one of the documents preserved in the
Tenth Book os Diogenes Laertius, was known as the Short Sum-
mary (μικρὰ ἐπιτομὴ) of the Epicurean system. There was also a
Long Summary (μακρὰ ἑπιτομή); and recent editors have argued
that the Long Summary is the main source which Lucr. used. This
cannot be proved or disproved, because the Long Summary is not
extant. But this may sasely be said—that Lucr.‚ who speaks of the
nmgnifonles (l. 412) and aurea dicta (iii η) of his revered master,
was not the man to shrink from studying the great work unabridged,
the Περὶ Φύσεως itseH, in all its thirty-seven volumes.

4 ι 8. ut repetam...pertexere, ‘to resume the weaving of my task':
the inf. is an accus.‚ governed by repetam.

419, 4²0· ‘The universe, then, is formed of two substances.'

419. omnis: gen. sing. neut. governed by natura: cf. Plut. Adu.
Col. c. 11 (of Epicurus) τὸ πᾶν παντὸς φύσιν ὀνομάζειν εἴωθε. The
notable fondness of Lucr. sor this form of periphrasis (eg. natura
inanis for inane l. 363) may be due to the example of Epicurus.

Cf. Cic. D.N.D. ii 82 (Epicurus teaches) omnium, quae sint,
naturam esse corpora et inane et quae iis accidant.

omnis ut eet is a genitive, suited to the metre, of omne quod est
(1. 958).

igitur, ‘to resume.'
