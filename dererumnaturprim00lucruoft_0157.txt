NOTES 123

978. flnl, ‘at the mark' . locative.

ln 976 fine=a limit, in 979 it=tlze limit: we know already how
sreely Lucr. uses the same word in different senses in the same passage.

(But perhaps fim¹ is dat., ‘as a limit’ to its motion, locet being
coordinate with probeat officz'alque.)

980. sequar, ‘I shall follow you‚’ wherever you shift to.

oras: the borders of the universe.

981. telo: instr. abl.: ‘what will be done with the dart,' i.e.
what will happen to it.

982. consistere, ‘be fixed’: a passive of constituere.

983. effugium: an echo from l. 975: cf. l. 877.

fugae copia, ‘the room given sor ssight)

984. praeterea: thirdly. The third argument for the infinity of
the universe begins here.

This argument depends upon the motion of atoms through void,
which Lucr. has not yet described. According to Epicurus, all free
atoms sall downwards owing to their weight; but they also have
the power to swerve very slightly from the perpendicular, and this
swerve brings them into collision with other atoms and makes
creation of res possible. Now, suppose the universe were bounded
in all directions, the existence os what may be called its roos and
walls would matter less, because atoms that struck against these
would rebound, owing to their weight‚ and collide with other
atoms. But if the universe had a floor, what Lucr. calls imum,
atoms which struck against it could never rise again3 and in the
course of infinite time all atoms would corne to rest upon that floor,
and no visible thing would exist in the universe.

985. undique, i.e. at the top, bottom, and sides; but it is the
second os these which is shown to be of special importanee.

986. iam. ‘by this time.’

materiai, ‘of atoms.'

987. confluxet for confluxisset: cs. l. ἰ 3 3 consumpse.

988. Lucr. suddenly shists his statement for a moment from the
universe to our world: this makes it possible to add pictui‘esque detail.

990. quippe ubi: cf. l. 182.

cumulata, ‘in one heap.’

991. subsidendo: a fine instance os sound answering to sense.

99²- principiorum corporibus: yet another name for atoms.
