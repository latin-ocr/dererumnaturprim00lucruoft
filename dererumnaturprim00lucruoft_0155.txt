omne is an adj.

958-1013. T lte universe is boundless. For (ι) tlzere is nothing
outside it, to bound it,· every point in it alike is centre. (τ) Sup-
posing it to be limited, {f a man were to stand al the vage and tlcrow
a spear, the weapon must either go on or stop short: in the former
case, there z‘s void, in tlze second, tlzere is body, beyond the supposed
limit: which proves that tlze universe is unlt'mited. (3) Suppose
again that it is limz'ted: in that case all atoms would have come to
rest at tlte lowest point, and nothing visible would exist anywlzere.
Aloms, in fact, aro in constant motion, because there is no lower
limit to tlte universe. T herefore space extends to infinity. (4) Outside
the universe there is nothing· which can bound it, as the sea bounds
the land. Nor can it set (munds to itself; sor zts two compotemus,
body and void, are such that their alternatim must extend to
infinity, unless one (ff the two by z'lsels so extends.

Before proving that body and void are each infinite, Lucr. first
gives four prooss that both, taken together, are infinite.

The whole argument is more difficult to follow, because Lucr.
uses so many names sor the universe: he calls it omne quod est
(1. 958), summa (l. 963), omne (1. 967), omne quod est spatium
(l. 969). spatium summai totius omne (1. 984), rerum summa
(l. 1008). omnia (1. 1011): by each of these seven names he means
exactly the same thing.

The first proof is that given by Epicurus: cf. Usener l.l. p. 72 τὸ
πᾶν (omne) ἄπειρόν ἐστι. τὸ ’γὰρ πεπερασμένον ἄκρον (extremum)
ἔχει· τὸ δὲ ἄκρον παρ’ ἔτερόν τι θεωρεῖται. ‘The universe is infinite.
For what is finite has an extremity, and the extremity of anything
is discerned by comparison with something else!

the definite article: the gen„ omnis ut est, occurred in l. 4¹9·

nulla. regione uiarum, ‘in no direction of its paths'. Munro
explains thus: ‘take whichever os the roads through the uni·
