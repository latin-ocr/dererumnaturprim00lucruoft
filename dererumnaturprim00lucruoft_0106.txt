72 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

turbidus, ‘darkened.’
287. molibus, ‘the piles’ of the bridges.
288. dat, ‘it causes’: Lucr. osten uses dare with the sense of

facere, e. g. dare motus=mouer22

289. grandia saxa, ‘the huge stones’ of the bridges.

ruit...obstat‚ lit. ⁶ where anything blocks its waveS‚ it overthrows
it’: quicquid has the sense of quidque, as often in Lucr.: sor the
constr.‚ cf. l. 15.

291. procubuere, ‘have borne down': when cum means ‘when-
ever‚’ and refers to present time, it is followed in classical Latin by
the perf. ind.: see n. to l. 3¹9·

293· uertice torto, ‘in whirling eddy.’

²95· etiam atque etiam=‘1 insist’: again l. 1049.

296. factis et moribus, ‘in their works and ways.'

The poetical amplitude of these descriptions of storms and flood
must be attributed to Lucr. alone, and not to his Greek originals.
Epicurus was a man of science who despised literature.

300. aestus, ‘hears'

tuimur: in Lucr. tui is always ‘to see‚' tueri either ‘to see' or
‘to protect.’

uoces, ‘articulate soumis?

303. sensus impellere: again iv 527. Lucr. here suffers from the
‘poverty of his native tongue.’ Sounds etc. strike, not upon the
senses themselves but on the organs of sensation ε Epicurus can say
κινεῖν τὸ αἰσθητήριον, but the word sensorium was not invented before
the time of the schoolmen.

Luer. deals at length with the phenomena of sensation iv 522—705.

305. denique=thirdly.

fluctifrago, κυματοαγεῖ, ‘where the waves break': see n. to l. 3.
