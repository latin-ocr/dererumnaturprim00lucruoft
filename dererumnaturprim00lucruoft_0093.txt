NOTES 59

sign that he is in bad health. This would be clearer if Lucr. had
uritten somnone: and so Bentley wished to read: but the distinction
between ·que and -ue is slight in early Latin.

¹34· audireque: the Augustan poets did not append -que to a
short e, finding the sound disagreeable.

135. Cf. iv 734 quorum morte obita tellus amplectitur ossa:
the different order here avoids the cacophony of coram, quorum.

136-145. Ι know (he difficulty of writz'ng a Lalin poem on such a
subject ,· but my friendslup sor you makes me willing to undergo any
labour in order to enlzj-„rlzten your mind.

This paragraph is out os place. Terrorem in l. 146 clearly refers
to terrificet in l. ¹33· It is not probable that Lucr.‚ if he had com-
pleted his uork. would have lest this irrelevant paragraph in this
place: see the prelimmary note on p. 39.

136. nec me animi fallit: cf. 1. 922: animi is probably locative.

in my mind’: it is also used with some adjectives, such as aeger and
dubius.

reperta. a transl. of εὑρήματα, is osten used by Lucr. of philo-
sophical discover-ies.

¹37· inlustrare, ‘to throw light on.'

uersibus the emphasis salls here: to write such a work in prose
would have been sar easier: why Lucr. chose verse, he tells in
11· 935-950·

esse. though it ends the verse. has no emphasis: see n. to 1. 24·

138. multa...sit agendum: for the constr„ see n. to 1. 111.

nouis uerbis: Lucr. has to invent his terminology.

¹39· egestatem linguae: cs. 1. 832 (where see n.) and iii 260
patrii sermonis egestas. Munro’s admirable discussion of this point
(vol. 11 p. 10 foll.) should be known to every student of Lucretius
or of Latin. His main points are these: (1) classical Greek is the
richer and more expressive tongue3 (2) the Latin of Lucretius and
Cicero was far superior to contemporary Greek3 (3) Lucretius was
able to convey the substance os any Greek original.

rerum nouitatem: Lucr. makes no pretensions to originality as a
philosopher: his sole object is to repr‹›duce the system of Epicurus:
but one of his difficulties is, that philosophical questions (res) are
unfamiliar (nouae) to Romans. 1t must be remembered that all the
philosophie works of Cicero are of later date than this poem.
