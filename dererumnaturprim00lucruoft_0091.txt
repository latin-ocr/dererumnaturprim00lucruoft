NoTEs 57

cluerot=esset. Lucr. is notably fond of alternatives sor the verb
csse.

120. praeterea tamen: as well as transmigration‚ and in spite of
transmigration : both theories cannot be true os the same person, os
Homer, for instance.

Acherusia templa, ‘a realm of Acheron': Acheruns, from
Αχέρων, one of the infernal rivers, is the equivalent in early Latin
sor Αδης.

templa is used freely in early Latin with the sense of loca: Lucr-
has linguai templa (the mouth) iv 624, mentis templa v 103; Plautus
calls the sea Neptunia templa (Mil. Glor. 413).

122. ‘Though neither our souls nor our bodies survive to get
there‘: the subj. is due to oratio obliqua. The word permanere is
regularly used of the continued existence of the soul: cs. Cic. Tusc.
Disp. i 18 animum censent alii statim dissfipari, alii diu permanere;
Ovid A. A. ii 120 (of the mind) solus ad extremos permanet ille
rogos.

¹23· quaedam simulacra, ‘mysterious ghosts': the εἴδωλα of
the Homeric poems, which are only a shadow of the living man, in
body and in mind.

simulacra..,miris is repeated by Virgil, Georg. i 477. but
apparently in a different sense: for he means it to be iinpressive‚
whereas Lucr. is surely making sun of these ghosts: he says in
effect, ‘as they have no bodies, it is strange that they should be
pale‘3 and he might have added: ‘it' the ghost has no soul, how
could Homer's ghost instruct Ennius ?’

¹24. unde, ‘from there‚' i.e. from Acheron.

semper florentis, ἁειθαλοῦς, ‘immortal.’

η 5. speciem = simulacrum.

lacrimas: because the Homeric ghosts, when they appear in this
world, weep sor their own comfortless existence.

126. rerum naturam here=the transmigration of souls: the
ghost os Homer did not lecture to Ennius on ‘physics’ in general,
but explained how the soul of Homer had passed into Ennius:
psychology is a part of rerum natura.

127-130 refer back to ll. 54, 55: 1 must, says Lucr.‚ amend my
original programme and add to it a third topic—a discussion of
psychology. This is contained in Books iii and iv.
