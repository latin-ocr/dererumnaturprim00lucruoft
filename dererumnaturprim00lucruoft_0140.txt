106 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

741. mag-m magno...casu, ‘great men were they, and great was
their sall': an echo of Hom. ll. xvi 776 κεῖτο μέγας μεγαλωστί.

ibi, :in principiis, is emphatic.

742-5. Their first error is twofold: (ι) while believing in motion,
they deny void outside res; (2) while admitting that some res are soft,
they deny void inside res.

742. rebus=rerum numero, ‘the universe': see n. to 1. 330. For
the impossibility of motion without void, cf. 11. 335-345.

743. constituunt, ‘they allow.’

raraS, ‘porousss

744. rorem: solem MSS.: but the sun does not seem a good
instance of something soft and porous; alm, os the four elements of
Empedocles one (water) is omitted, while fire is represented twice
over. For these reasons Christ's emendation is accepted.

For rorem=aquam‚ cf. ll. 771, 777.

746. Their second error also is twofold: these philosophers deny
(1) the indivisible atom3 (2) the least parts of which the atom is
composed.

747. fragori :frangend0, ‘the process ot div1si0n.’

748. prorsum :omnium

in rebus=in rerum numero.

749-752. ‘Though we see that the extremity of anything is that
which, judged by our senses, is seen to be the minimum’ (i.e. the
least perceptible thing in nature); ‘hence you can infer that, since
things which you cannot see' (i.e. atoms) ‘have an extremity, there
is a minimum in them also.’

For this extremum:minimmnmammen, see nn. besore l. 599
and to l. 599.

750. uidetur, ‘is seen,' not ‘seems’z there is no deception in the
matter: the cacumen of a res really is a minimum in the visible
sphere, and the cacumen of an atom is a minimum in the invisible
world grasped by thought alone.

(Giussani argues that the cacumina of a res denote the smallest
particles which retain the properties os the substance: e.g. the
cacumina of milk are white and sweet; but any further division
reduces them to atoms which are neither white nor sweet.)

752. quod is taken above as=quonzam2 it is possible that it may
be a relative pron. governed by habent.
