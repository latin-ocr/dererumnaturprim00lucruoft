250—261. The fourth argument is directed to the same point as
the second: we see, in the case of rain which is converted into the
fruits of the earth, an instance osa res which perishes, but whose
atonis survive. But the philosopher has had his innings, and the
poet now comes sorward. What follows is not philosophy but
mythology taken from the Greek dramatists: it describes the ‘mystic
marriage' (ἱερὸς γάμος) between the sky and the earth, to which all
life and joy is due; and this gives occasion for a picture of spring,
as beautiful in its simplicity as any poet ever drew. Cf. ii 99¹
denique caelesti sumus omnes semine 0r2·undi,· Ι omnibus ille idem
pater est, unde alma lz'quenlt‘s Ι umoris gustas maler cum terra re-
cepit, Ι feta parit nitidas fruges arbustaque laeta Ι el genus humanum.

‘25²- nitidae fruges, ‘goodly crops’: a common phrase in Lucr.

²53· ipsae is used to avoid arm-es which is unmetrical. To
translate ip5ae ‘os themselves’ would be a scientific error, as Epicurus

254. hjnc...porro‚ ‘by them in turn': this series reeurs constantly
in this book: rain feeds plants‚ and plants feed animals. It is
possible that Lucr. was, like Epicurus, a vegetarian3 he always
speaks of fruges as the natural food of man.

2 55. pueris florere, ‘blossom with children’: the verb suggests
that children are like flowers: perhaps he is thinking os κουροτρόφοι
as an epithet of πόλεις.

256. nouis, ‘youngff

2 57. fessae...ping·u:l‚ ‘laden with satness’: pingue is treated as a
noun.
