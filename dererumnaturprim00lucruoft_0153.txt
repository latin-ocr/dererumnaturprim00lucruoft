NOTES 119

(ll. 1-25). Lachmann argued that the original editor found Book iv
without an exordium and therefore prefixed these verses from
Book i. But repetition is so common in Lucr.‚ that he may fairly be
supposed, on the principle of δὶς καὶ τρίς τὰ καλά, to have repeated
the verses himself where they stand in Book iv.

The first lines were osten imitated by Virgil and later poets:
references are given by Munro.

926 soll. The claim of priority is asserted four times over: and it
is true that Lucr. was a pioneer, because he expounded the
Epicurean system in verse.

9²7· iuuat, ‘1 love...)

929. inde = ex eis locis.

930. There is an ellipse after this line: < I deserve this garland >
because etc.

931. prlmum..., deinde: thus Lucr. claims credit first for the
new gospel which he proclaims, and sets his claims as a poet at a
lower rate: see n. to 1. 54.

The et clause explains what the magnae res are, i.e. the doctrines
which free the mind [rom superstitious fears.

932. relig-ionum...nodis: see n. to l. 65.

933. To Lucr. his poetry is of secondary importance: it is merely
a means of making the philosophie system attractiva the jain, in
fact, under which the powder is concealtd.

934. contingens, here and below, is a compound of tango, notos
tingo or lingue.

cuncta: a pardonable exaggeration: there are many passages in
the poem which cannot be said to possess charm (lepor); but
nobility of thought and purity of expression pervade it all.

935. non ab nulla. ratione, ‘not without good reason’: ab is
difficult: perhaps it is akin to the ab of l. 693.

936. medentes: medici: participle used as noun.

937. dare and διδόναι are technical in this senset from δόσις
comes our ⁴ dese-⁹

conamur is expressive: to make a reluctant child swallow a dose
of medicine is almost impossible.

poeula, ‘the cup': the plur. is used for the sake os metre.

940 tenus always follows its case, which is either abl. sing. or

gen. plur.
