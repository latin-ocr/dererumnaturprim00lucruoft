54 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

felix faustusque : a reference to the form of speech used by the
Romans when starting on public business of importance: quod

bonum, faustum, felix, fortunatumque sit (Cic. De Diu. i 102).

101. tantum...ma10rum, ‘such awsul sin’: the usual sense is ‘so
many evils.'

102—135. Even {f you come to believe in the doctrine os Epicurus,
yet your belief may be shaken by the terrible stories that are falsely
told of everlasting punishment after death. This sear, the great
weapon of superstition, is due to ignoronce of the soul's origin and
destiny. Men do not know whether the soul is mortal or immortal;
nor do they know whether it is destroyed by death, or goes down to a
world below, or passes into other anz'mals. (Our great poet Ennius
held two of these theories at once: he believed in transnu'gration of
the soul, but also in an abode of the dead below the earth. From
there, he says, the ghost of Homer rose up and taught him.)

T hemfore, to the two topics already promised, an explanation os
the gods and heavenly bodies and the Atomic T heory, I must add a
third of special importante, an explanation of the soul‚· and l must
show that apparitions of the dead do not prove the immortality of the
soul.

102. tutemet : the double suffix is rare, but occurs iv 915.

lam is difficult: perhaps it = ‘as things stand’; and so again in
1. 104.

uatum, ‘of the seers': the word includes all champions of the
popular religion—poem, priests, and mythologers. uates underwent
a curious change of meaning: from Ennius to Lucr. it was a eon-
temptuous term and was ousted by the Greek word poeta; but
virgil and Horace ennobled the word: in their writings uates is
superior to poeta and means ⁴ an inspired poet-²

¹03· desciscere: Lucr. is sanguine and reckons on the conversion
of Memmius: many passages (e.g. 11. 52, 53) show that he was not,
when Lucr. was writing, an adherent of the Epicurean school.

104. quippe etenim, ‘f0r, to be sure.'

105. somma, ‘fancies’ quae, ‘enough to... .’

rationes, ‘calculations.'

106. fortunas tuas turbare, ‘to cloud your happiness’: for this
sense of fortunae (osten = wealth), cf. v 1179 (of the gods)
fortunisque ideo longe praestare putabant, Ι quod mortis timor haud
