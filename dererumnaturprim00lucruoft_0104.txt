70 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

2 58. candens lacteus: Lucr. does not dislike a double adjective
without et, which is avoided by the Augustan poets: but one os the
adjectives is generally equivalent to a genitive of material: so here
lacteus=lactis. See n. to 1. 946.

2 59. noua. proles are the young animals and especially the lambs,
as is shown by the delightsul description that follows.

260. infirmis, ‘staggering.'

lasciua luda, ‘frisks and gambols.’

261. lacte mero, lit. ‘pure milk'; but Lucr. is thinking of the
other meaning of merum: the milk intoxicates these young creatures
like wine.

nouenae we must translate by ‘young'; but so we lose the
tenderness of the diminutive. Lucr. shows a marked sympathy for
animals and interest in their lise.

262. uidentur, sc. perire.

263. quando, ‘since.’

alid ex alio, ‘one thing out of another': alid, an older form, is
here more convenient metrically than aliud: cf. 11. 407, 1 1 15.

264. adiuta, ‘reinsorced.’ The death of A lets loose a store os
atoms which Nature uses to make B, a new res made out of old
atoms.

The simplicity of these two lines should not blind the reader to
their deep and tragical truth.

265—328. T hat tlze atoms are invisible is no proof that they are not
material. For there are in nature many invisible forces which work
material ffcts. Consider (1) tlte wind, wlzicb produces in a tempest
similar ffrts to a stood of waters,· (2) tlze phenomena of smeH, heat,
and cold; (3) tlzc phenomena eff evaporation ‚· (4) the invisible detri-
tion osmetal and stone ‚· (5) tlte growtlz and decay of living things.
We conclude that Nature works by means of material particles, so
small as to be invisible.

Luer. is now preparing the way sor his account of atoms and deals
at length with a preliminary objection: is it possible that an
invisible thing should be formed of matter? Epicurus taught that
all knowledge is originally derived from the senses, so that it is
specially difficult sor him to deal with this objection. He himself
described the atoms as σώματα λόγῳ θεωρητά. (Usener Epic.
p. 191).
