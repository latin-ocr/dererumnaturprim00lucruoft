xxiv INTRODUCTION

headin gs mentioned above are reckoned in. Hence Lach-
mann drew two important conclusions: that each of these
passages eonsists of one leaf of the original MS„ and that
it had 26 lines to a page.

Every extant MS. of Lucretius is derived from a single
source, a manuscript written in small letters in France or
Ireland in the 7th or 8th century. Had that manuscript
perished before any copies were made, we should know
nothing of Lucretius except the few single lines which
happen to be quoted by later writers. And in that case
our whole estimate of the Latin genius would have been
materially lower than it actually is.

IV
BERNAYS AND GIUSSANI

Of Lachmann's work something was said above.
Munro's edition, with its rich Introductionsl, ample
Commentary, and incomparable Translation, is known
to every student of Lucretius. There remain two editors
to whom I owe so much that I wish to speak briefly of
them here.

JAcoss BERNAYs, born at Hamburg in 1824, spent
nearly all his life at Bonn and died there in 1881. A master
of Greek learning, he would have added distinction to
any chair in Europe, but he was never elected to a pro-
fessorship: his whole life was devoted to the acquisition
of knowledge and the writing of books. It is reported of
Ingram Bywater that he never mentioned the name of

¹ The late Sir Godfrey Lushington, as an official in the Home
Department, had at one time the duty of deciding whether
condemned criminals should be hanged or reprieved. He told
me that in the intervals of studying the documents concerning
such cases, no reading gave such relies to his tension of mind
as the two Introductions in Munro's Lucretius.
