world. From kim we have learnt tlte laws ofnalure and the division set
between the possible and the impossible. Hence we in our turn triumph
over and stamp on superstition.

62. ante oculos, ⁴ clear to see.‘

63. graui sub religione, ‘beneath the weight of superstition)
Epicurus taught that gods exist, but that all attempts of man to win
their favour or avert their wrath are vain and therefore supersti-
tious.

The first syll. of religio is naturally short ε Lucr. lengthens it, as
he does the first syll. of reliquiae and some other words, to make
them possible in his metre.

64. caput: she is like the Gorgon, Medusa : to look on her head
is fatal to men.

caeli regionibus : because the gods are popularly supposed to live
there.

65. super and instans form a single participle, ‘ lowering over-
head’ upon men3 and the words are intended to suggest the noun
superstitio. This kind of play on words is found elsewhere in Lucr.:
cf. l. 932, where religionum nodis is lit. ‘the knots of tying,' an
equivalent sor ‘the setters of superstition.’ The practice of Aeschylus
shows that a pun was not necessarily ludicrous to the ancient mind ς
nor indeed was it so to some of the moderns: thus Milton says of
the ravens which sed Elijah: ‘though ravening, taught to abstain
from what they brought,’ but does not intend to amuse the reader-

66. Graius homo: i.e. Epicurus, a citizen of Athens. It is re-
markable that Lucr., though repeatedly declaring the debt of man-
kind to Epicurus, never mentions his name but once (iii 1042), where
he appears as the last and greatest of a list of great men, so that
mere allusion is impossible. There is only one explanation os this
silence ι that the name was too sacred to be written except in case
of necessity. This feeling seems personal to Luem of Epicureans
in general we are told that they kept pictures of their master in
their houses and wore his likeness in rings: in fact, they showed
regard and affection for his memory, but not this religious awe.

In giving priority to Epicurus as a scientific discoverer (l. 71),
Lucr. is unjust to Democritus (b. 460 B.c.), one os the greatest names
in the history of scientific enquiry; the Atomic Theory was taken
over from him, with slight modificadon, by Epicurus. But Lucr. is
