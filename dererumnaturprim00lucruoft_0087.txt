90. hunc propter, ‘ near him ¹ : propter in this sense is commonly

description os this scene in Aesch. Agam. 215 foll-z thus this l. is
an echo of κληδόνας πατρῴας (2 38), sublata uirum manibus of λαβεῖν
ἀέρδην (244), while 1. 99 recalls τέκνον δαίξω (218).

not here its commoner metaphorical sense of ‘ result.’
