128 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

¹04²· plagae, ‘blows’ of atoms: the context shows, what Lucr.
does not make clear, that these atoms are not assimilated.

¹043· est concffiata ‘ has been formed by a combination of
atonis?

1044. cudere, ‘to hammer on...‚’ governs partem.

1045. aliae, sc. plagae, i.e. impinging atoms; but these are such
as can enter the world and be assimilated.

queatur: cf. iii 1010 expleri potestur: in each case the passive
is due to the passive ins-2 so, with a passive ins„ coeptus rum and
desitus sum are used by the best writers sor coepi and desii.

1047. principiis rerum: these are the atoms inside the aggregate
which we call a world.

¹049· etlam atque etiam: cf. 1. ²95*

multa, sc. primordia, the acc. of principiis.

¹050· plagae...ipsae, ‘even the blows’ of atoms which are not
assimilated.

¹05¹- uie, ‘supply' z the nom. after opus est is common enough.

1052-1082. Bewarc os tlte Stoic doctrine, that all things tend to a
centre, and that this tende-my accounts jor the stabilz'ty of the world,
and enable-s the inhabitants ostile antipodes to walk about upside down
without falling qffi T he fact is, that the universe lzas no centre ; and,
ij it had, things would not tend to take up a position there. Space‚
wherever it exists, must give way to body.

Lucr. now attacks the Stoic theory of a single finite world sur-
ro'unded by infinite space, and especially their view that our world is
held together by the centripetal tendency of its parts.

1052. illud in his rebus: see n. to l. 80.

1053. ‘That all things press‚ as they say, towards the centre of
the universe’: ‘they' are the Stoics‚ who held that our world
remains fixed at the centre of the universe.

10 54. mundi naturam = mundum.

1055. lctibus: these are the plagae of 1. 1042.

quoquam, ‘in any direction.'

¹057· sl credis=non potes credere: for the form ot the sentence,
cf. 1. 848, iv 366 acra si credis priuatum lumine posse Ι indugredi:
we might say ‘But can you really believe, that...?'

Lucr. himself, when trying to account for the stability os the earth,
is reduced to strange expedients (v 534-563).
