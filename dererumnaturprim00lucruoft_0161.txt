NOTES 127

in Peter simple, where Mr Muddle believed in a similar cycle of
27,672 years.

1030. motus, of atoms in combination.

1031. The three divisions 01 1110 world, sea, earth, and sky, are
particularised with some detail.

fluminis umus, ‘flowing water,'flumen having its primitive sense.

1032. uapore: see n. to l. 49¹-

¹033· summissa...floreat‚ ‘to come up and flourish’: the sense
01 summittere seems akin to that of 1. 8.

1034. uiuant=durent: 101· Lucr. expressly denies life to the
heavenly bodies: cf. v 140 1011. Τ1115 was a point of difference
between Stoics and Epicureans.

1035—1051. Every world, while continually giving out atoms, is
being pelted by atoms from outside‚ some of which are assimilated‚
while others cannot be assimilated‚ and rebound. Let A stand for the
former kind and B for the latter. When the supply of A atoms 111115
short, the number of atoms in the world will decrease, and it will
die (1035—1041; cf. also ii 1105 1011.). Τ110 blows of B atoms cannot
save it: they can beat back the escaping 3101115 and keep together 3
part 101 a while, so as to give time 101 reinforcements of A atoms to

come up (1042—1045); but they cannot strike every point at every
instant; and, when they rebound, atoms in the world will follow
them out and escape. There must therefore be an unfailing supply 01
A atoms (¹046-¹0⁴9)· Besides. even 101 1110 partial help given by the
B atoms, there must be an unfailing supply of them also (1050, 1051).

1035. facerent: the subjects are amnes, terra, and aetheris ignes.

1036. suborm=suppeditari‚ ‘to be supplied’ x cf. ii 1138 suboriri
ac suppeditare: the prefix of the verbs does not appear to mean
‘from beneath'; for the atoms swarm in from 311 sides.

1037. ‘Whenee they can make good their 105505 111 03011 0350
(quaeque) before it is too late)

amissa quaeque is acc.

1039. corpus, ‘substance’: cf. l. 810.

omma=a world 2 in 1. 101 1 11 510οᾱ 101 the universe.

1040. suppecutare: see n. to 1. 547.

1041. auersa. uiai, ‘turned away from its course': Virgil has the

gen. after desisto, Horace after desino: all three constructions are
imitations of Greek.
