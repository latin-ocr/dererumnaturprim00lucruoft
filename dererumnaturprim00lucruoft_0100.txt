66 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

The amount os alliteration in this passage is remarkable, even for

Lucr.

203. reddita, ‘assigned’
204. e quamam, ‘and what can arise out of those atoms is fixed.’

205-207. Lucr. here sums up, as if he had stated all his proofs.
But next (ll. 208-214) he adds a sixth proof, of a less general kind,
srom agriculture. On comparison with v 210 foll„ it seems highly
probable that Lucr., while writing Book v, hastily inserted these
seven lines in Book i, without necessary changes, and without even
noticing that they ought to come after 1. 204. See n. at l. 146.

207. proferrier: this archaic form of the pass. inf„ common in
Lucr., is used by him only when -ier is preceded by a long syllable3
but loquier (=l0quz·) is found in earlier Latin.

208. postremo=six1h1y.

209. manibus: either abl. of instrument, or dat. aster reddere:
Munro declares sor the former.

210. uidelicet has the constr. of uidere licet.

211, 212 are taken from v 210 si non fecundas uertentes uomere
glebas Ι terraique solum subzgentes cimus ad ortus, 1 sponte sua
nequeant liquidas existere in auras. In the hurry of transcription‚
Lucr. has made a little slip: it is not primordia (as is here stated)
but fruges which the ploughman brings to birth from the soil.

213· nulla, sc. primordia.

quaeque, ‘each kind of crop.’

214. meliora: they might also be much worse, if they did not
grow from a certum semen : but that result might be attributed merely
to want of cultivation.

215-264. The second axz‘om of our system is this: Nothing is
utterly destroyed: what appears to be destroyed is only resolve-d into
the atems tlzatfhrmed it. This axiom is proved by (1) tlte gradual
dz'sappfarance os created tlzz'ngs,· (2) the actual existence of visible
matter in tlzz‘s world‚· (3) the dzfferent force required to destroy
dtffi’rent thz'ngs‚· (4) tlte growtlz andyoutlz and beauty of tlte world.

Lucr. divides the law of Epicurus into two statements: (1) apparent
destruction is merely disruption into atoms; (2) the atoms are in-
destructible. Of the four arguments which follow, the first and third
deal with the former statement, the second and fourth with the latter.

As no fresh matter is created out of nothing, and no existing
