NOTES 87

materies rerum=corpus.

47²· locus ac spatium are used here by Lucr. for inane, to show
his meaning—that the movements described in the next five lines
were only made possible by the existence of void as well as body:
cf.11. 426, 427.

474. Phrygio belongs in sense to Alexandri, not to pectorez the
figure is used here, to avoid repetition of the i sound.

Alexandros is an Homeric name sor Paris.

475. clara, ‘famous’

476. Troianis: abl. governed by clam: only one other instance of
this construction is quoted—Caes. B. C. ii 32, 8 nonne sibi clam
uobis salutem fuga petiuit ?

durateus...equus: the epithet is taken from Hom. Od. viii 493:
Plautus (Bacch. 9 36) has lzjgneus equus. Lucr. does not shrink from
using Greek words: thus for ‘eubs’ he uses, not catuli, as one might
expect, but scymni (σκύμνοι) ν 1036 ; which makes it surprising that
he never uses the name atomi sor his primordia.

477. nocturno: the Greek warriors sallied forth from the womb
of the horse by night.

For this comparison between the fire of love in the heart of Paris,
and the fire that burnt Troy, cs. Cic. Verr. ii 5, 9² una alque eadem
nox erat, qua praetor amoris turpissimi flamma, classis Romana
praedonum incendio conflagrabat.

478. funditus omnis, ‘from first to last. ’

419 constare and esse seem to mean the same here.

480. neo—eadem, ‘and are not spoken of in the same way‚’ i..e
are not terms os the same kind.

eadem is a spondee here: cf. eaedem l. 306.

483-502. Badies are of two kinds: (ι) simple‚· (2) composite. The
simple bodies, because they contain no void, are indestructz'ble. All
created things, even ts they appear to conlain no void, do really
contain it, as experiment proves. But reason proves tlze existence of
these simple bodies ; and these we maintaz'n to be the primal elements
af creatum

Lucr. is again using the Short Summary of Epicurus. τῶν σωμά-
των τὰ μέν ἐστι συγκρίσεις (concilim) τὸ. δ’ ἐξ ὦν αι συγκρίσεις πεποί-
ηνται· ταῦτα (the latter) δέ ἐστιν ἄτομα καὶ ἀμετάβλητα (unchangeable)
(Usener l.l. p. 6).
