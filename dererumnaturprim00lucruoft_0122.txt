88 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

484. concilium=01971<pwtsz see n. to l. 182.
All composite corpora are res, ‘created things.’

486. stinguere, ‘to destroy.’
solido: the adj. has in this connexion the technieal sense of ‘free

from void’: it stands sor the epithets πλήρης and στερεός used by
Epicurus.

demum goes with ea, ‘they‚ and they only....’

487. etsi, ‘and yet.'

488. in robus: see n. tol. 330.

489. saepta domorum, ‘the walls os houses': cf. l. 354. These
instances are repeated with additions vi 936 soll.

To our senses stone and metal appear to be solz‘da; but they are
not so in reality‚ because other substances can pass through them,

or they can be broken up.
491. fere, ‘conimonly‚’ is A. E. Housman’s conjecture sor fero:

he quotes Virg. Gemg. iii 363 aeraque dissiliunt uolgo.

uapore, ‘by heat,’ the only meaning of the word in Lucr. ε in his
view, heat was a stream of material particles of fire.

49²· cum, ‘both‚' followed by tum, ‘and'z 1 follow Ernout in
keeping the MS. reading.

493. glacies aeris, ‘the ice of copper': glacies was probably
ehosen to suit the verb liquescit (melts).

494. penetrale: active: cf. Virg. Georg. i 93 penetrabile frzgus.

495. quando=quand0quidem, ‘since.'

rite, ‘in customary sashion)

496. sensimus, ‘ we feel at once‘: some explain this as a ‘gnomie’
aorist—‘ we osten feel' ; but Madvig shows that this construction was
probably unknown in Latin os the time of Lucr. (Opusc. Acad. p. 49²)-

lympharum rore is merely a periphrasis for aqua. The Romans
poured water, either hot or cold‚ into their wine.

497. Sensus (αἴσθησις) cannot discover the existence of anything
solz'dum3 but ratio (λογισμός, reasoning) forces us to admit it.

498. natura rerum he1·e=science, i.e. the study os seience.

499. Luer. promises that in a sew verses he will prove two
qualities of atoms: (1) solz‘dt'las; (2) aeternitas. The second of these
depends upon the first.

502. omnis rerum summa, ‘the universe‚' i.e. all the res (created
things) which the universe contains.
