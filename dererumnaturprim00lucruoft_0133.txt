63 5—920 form the polemical section of the book. Lucr. here
seeks to disprove certain rival theories of the composition of matter
maintained by other philosophers: these are (1) Heracleitus;
(2) Empedocles; (3) Anaxagoras. Of these the first is treated most
severely, because Heracleitus was to the Stoics what Democritus
was to the Epicureans—the originator of their physical science,
and the contest between the two schools was still keen in the time
os Lucretius. In speaking of Empedocles, on the other hand, Lucr.
uses the language os reverence and even os affection.

635-644. There-’fore those wlco have held that all things are formed
out offin, are widely mistaken. T lte thies qf these is Heracleum,
whose fame is mainly due to his oracular style.

635. quapropter, ‘for this reason,’ that Lucr. has proved the
elements of matter to be atoms.

materiem rerum, ‘ the primary substance ' or ἀρχή, out os which
all things are made.

636. summam, ‘the universe,' i.e. everything contained in the
universe.

637. lapsi...uidentur, ‘have evidently strayed.’

638. Heracleitus of Ephesus, the greatest of the Ionian philo-
sophers, was born about 500 B.C. Of his treatise Περὶ Φύσεως only
fragments are preserved. Both Socrates and Cicero complained os
his obscurity; and there is still a great dispute as to the nature os
his primordial fire.

init proelia primus: this only means that Lucr. is going to attack
him before anyone else.

639. clarus—linguam, ‘whose fame is bright because os his dark
sayings‘: he was known as ὀ σκοτεινὸς for this reason.

inanis, ‘frivolous’

640. quamde: an old form of quam.

641. nendi, ‘sools': a retort aimed at the Stoics‚ who applied
this epithet to all mankind except their ideal Sage (sapiens).

642. inuersis-..uerblffi ‘symbolic language’: cs. Quint. viii 6, 44
ἀλληγορία, quam inuersz'onem interpretantur, aliud uerbis, aliud
sensu ostendit. The fragments of Heracleitus are full os such
language: e.g. he expressed the constant process of change in
things by the words πάντα ρεἳ. Epicurus, on the contrary, insisted
that words should be used in their simple sense: ἀνάγκη τὸ πρῶτον
