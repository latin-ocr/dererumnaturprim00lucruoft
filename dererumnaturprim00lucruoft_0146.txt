112 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

820. The list represents the four elements‚ caelum being=aera. ι

822. allis goes with commixta, alio modo with mouentur.

823. passim, ‘everywhere’

Cs. ll. 197, 912 soll., and ii 688 where this passage is repeated
with a supplement. Lucr. has a passion for this illustration which
he may have found in writings of Epicurus, and which is perhaps
older still. He says here: ‘though the same letters recur constantly,
yet my lines and words differ in sound and meaning3 just so one res
differs from another, although the two have many atoms in common.¹

824. elementa, ‘lette-rs.⁷

825. uersus, ‘lines' of either verse or prose.

necessest: cum tamen in Lucr. is generally followed by indic.‚
not subj.

826. re, ‘in meaning.’

sonanti can hardly be translated: the assonance with sonitu is of
course intentional.

827. elementa=the atoms of language: elementa are to uerba
what primordia are to res.

828. plura, lit. ‘more things’: we should say ‘more combinations
and permutations.¹

The Latin alphabet has 2 3 letters. Hence we may infer that there
are more than ²3 varieties of atoms: Lucr. nowhere says how many
there are—only that their number is limited‚ whereas the number of
each kind is unlimited.

829. unde=ex quibus.

uariae res quaeque, ‘the different kinds of things.’

830—858. T he theory qf Anaxagoras, tlzat each thing z's made up ο]
partz'cles like itself, is open to the same ab sections as llze theorias already
examined: (ι) he denies tlte existence of voz'd; (2) ke mazntains the
infinite diviszbility (ff matter ,· (3) lzis &articles are as frail and
perislzable as tlze llzz'ngs tlzey make.

Anaxagoras, born at Clazomenae in 499 B.C.‚ spent his manhood
at Athens till he was banished for impiety in 434. He published his
theory in a book of which only fragments are preserved. To the
Platonic Socrates the interesting feature of the theory was, that
Anaxagoras declared Mind (νοῦς) to be the universal cause (Plato
Phanio 97-98 B); but Lucr., as a materialist‚ takes no notice of this,
just as he ignored the metaphysica} importance of Heracleitvs.
