NOTES 105

Forsrltus, -ιῖς, m.‚ es. vi 364.

undis ends two successive lines: this seems permissible in Lucr.,
though some editors have recourse to emendation.

721. eius should be cuius, but a demonstrative pron. is substituted
for a second relative: there are many instances of this constr. in
Lucr., e. g. l. 686 (where quae as subject of mutant would be
regular), l. 154, l. 850.

722. uasta, ‘waste'z see n. tol. ¹¹5-

7²3· murmura, ‘rumblings'z this word always denotes an in—
articulate uolse, not necessarily a subdued noise.

colligere, ‘are nursing.'

724. eruptos: erumpere is often active in Lucr.

iterum, ‘once more,’ not ‘a second time.'

726. cum, ‘while‚' followed by indicative: see n. to l. 566.

727. uisenda, ‘worth visiting.’

728. Sicily is (ι) fertile, (2) populous.

731. pectoris, ‘genius’

Lucr. speaks of these poems with special emphasi5‚ because he had
found them, though inadequate scientifically, of service as models to
himself.

⁷134-762. Empedocles was far greater than lzis predecessors‚ who
themselves did muclz more to discover {ruth than tlte oracle of Delphi.
But he and they alike failed utterly to explain the composition os
matter. Their errors are four .· (1) tltey deny void ‚· (2) tlzey main-
tain the infinite divz‘sibilz'ty of matter ,· (3) their particles are sost and
therefore liable to destruction ,· (4) their partt'cles are mutally destruc·
live ancl therefi1r‹' unable to combine.

734. inferiores, than Empedocles.

7 3 5. partibus egregie multis, ‘ immensely,’ seems to be equivalent
to omnibus partibus, for which see Madvig on Cic. De Fin. ii 108.
Lucr. has multis partibus mobz'lt'or iv 34²-

738, 739 are repeated v 111, ιη.

certa magis is used sor the unmetrical certiore.

740. tamen answers to quamquam l. 7 36.

fecere ruinas, ‘have come crashing down’: cf. Cic. De Fz'n. i 18
illac Epicuri propriae ruinae (the capital error which follows is
peculiar to Epicurus) z the phrase is peculiar and may be taken from
this line os Lucu: see n. to 1. 74.
