date, and that Lucretius was born in 99 13.c. and died in
55 Bc. The latter date is confirmed to some extent by
the mention of Lucretius and his poem in a letter written
by Cicero to his brother Quintus in January or February
of the year 54 B.c. Of this letter more is said below.

Jerome's other statements have given rise to much
doubt and endless discussion. There is certainly some
reason for scepticism. A ‘love-philtre' seems to have no
place in sober biography. Further, with regard to the
alleged madness and suicide, it is strange that such a
tragical ending of a great poet is nowhere alluded to by
any subsequent Latin writer: and on the other hand, the
story sounds quite like a pious fiction invented by some-
one who was shocked by the heterodoxy of Lucretius.
A similar end was invented for Lucian, another Epi-
curean heretic: he is said by the lexicographer Suidas1
to have been torn to pieces by dogs, which may be a
distorted version of the fact that he had warm contentions
during his lifetiine with certain Cynic philosophers. Again
it is almost incredible that the poem was written in the
lucid intervals of insanity: in those parts of the poem
which are not obviously unfinished‚ the argument is
orderly, almost to pedantry, and the arrangement
masterly. And yet, for all this, Jerome’s account of his
death may be true:

‘We poets in our youth begin in giadness;
But thereos corne in the end despondency and madness.'

The statement that Cicero corrected the books implies
one fact which is certainly true—that Lucretius, like
Virgil after him, left his poem unfinished, and that it was
given to the world after his death by some other hand.
But we are not told what kind or amount of ‘ correction '
the editor supplied, nor even which Cicero was the editor,

² ⁴ It was customary for Suidas to invent a horrid death for
those whose doctrines he disliked' (T. Dyer in Smith's Die:-
tionary of Biografflm, 11 p. 814).
