NOTES 7 3

3¹ 1. qum ettam = fourthly.

solis annia, 'revolutions of the sun': annus is ‘a circuit‚’ and
anulus ‘a little circuit.'

3¹²· subter, ‘on the inner side,' where it touches the skin.

habendo, διὰ τὸ φορεῖν, ‘by wearing': the subject of the gerund is
not the ring bnt the wearer: a gerund so used is not passive: there
is merely a change of subject; and the object (eum) is omitted.

313. stilicidi, but slillcz; uilicus, but uz'lla; milla, but mille: the
rnle is that, where -ll- follows ἵ, one lis dropped, ise* follows.

315· strata uiarum, ‘paved streets’: cf. saepta domorum (l. 489).

iam goes with detrita: when the process is complete, we see it;
but we cannot see it while it is going on (cium deteruntur).

316. portas propter, ⁴ near the gates of towns’: for the position
ospropter, see n. to l. 90.

318. ‘By the repeated touch of those who greet them as they pass
by’: cf. Cic. Verr. iv 94 (οῖ’ a bronze statue of Hercules at Agri-
gentum) rz'clum cius ac mentum paulo sit allrz'tius, quod z'n precibus
ct gralulationibus non solnm id uenerari uerum etiam osculari
solent. Α familiar modern example is the toe os St Peter's statue at
Rome.

3¹9· cum sunt detrita, ‘when they are worn down’: cf.1. 315.
1 have altered sint of MSS. into sunt: for (1) the indicative is here
required by Latin idiom: see n. to l. 291; and (2) copyists pre·
serred the subjunctive after cum and osten changed u to i (sunt to
sint, uicerunt to uicerint) for that reason: see Madvig's note on Cic.
De Fin. v 4¹· If sint be kept, cum is causal, ‘since they have
been worn away'; but 1. 3 1 5 seems decisive against this interpretation.

3²0· corpora, ‘particles.'

321. speciem, ‘the power of seeing,' = τὸ ὁρᾶν.

natura. uidendi, ‘the nature of vision,’ i.e. the limitation of our
eyesight: our eyes, in fact, are not ‘patent double million magni-
fying gas microscopes of hextra power,’ or they might perceive
those particles.

32²· postremo: fifthly.

Luer. now turns from inorganic substanees to organie‚ so that 1. 326
is out of place and ought to have been included in the previous
argument. Here again the author never put the last hand to his
work.
