thinking os the ethical theory based by Epicurus upon scientific

grounds.
contra, ‘ in opposition ’ to her.
68. fama deum, ‘the story of the gods,’ i.e. the tales told of them.
fulmina: the weapon used by the supreme god to punish sinners.
This paragraph is especially full of alliteration, with repetition of
f. m, c, p, and u. Nor is there a finer paragraph in the poem.

69. compressit, ‘could repress.’

70. inritat is a contracted form of inritauit: both syntax and
mette show that the pres. is impossible here: cf. vi 587 disturbat
(=disturbanit) zcrbes3 in v 396 superdt (=superaus't) has been
introduced by conjecture.

effringere cet.: Nature‘s laws are compared to a fortress which
the great conqueror had to take by storm.

71. primus is better taken with ff¹c'ttgere than with cupiret. The
last word is an archaic form of cuperet: Lucr. has other similar
forms, e.g. moriri for mori.

7 3. flammantia moenia mundi, ‘the fiery walls of the world‚’ i.e.
the aetlzer which forins the limit oi our world, and in which the
burning stars are placed.

74. omne immensum, ‘the boundless universe) The peculiar cos-
mogony of Epicurus must be borne in mind, here and elsewhere in
the poem. The universe (τὸ πᾶν, omne) is infinite and contains an
infinite number of worlds (κόσμοι, mundi), which may be like or un-
like our world. Between worlds there are spaces (μετακόσμια, inter-
mundz'a) in which the gods live. Lucr. says that Epicurus was
enabled by his genius to pass the limits of our world; in thought he
passed out, through the irztermumz'ia, into the universe at large.
There he first mastered the secrets which Nature hitherto had
iealously hidden from man.

This conception is confusing to us, because we consider the stars
as other worlds, while Epicurus believed them to be small appendages
to our world.

peragrauit: the besieger os 1. 70 has now become an exploret and
pioneer.

mente animoque=by the power of thought. Lucr. often uses
the two nouns as synonyms. Cf. Cic. De Fm. ii 102 haec non erant
eius (i.e. Epicurus), qui innumerabiles mundos infinitasque regiones
