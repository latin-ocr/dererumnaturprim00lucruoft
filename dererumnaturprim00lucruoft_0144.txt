110 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

in aquam se uertit et cum ex aqua oritur aer, ex aere aether, cumque
eadem uicissim retro commeant.

789. haud uno...pacto‚ ‘on no account.'

790, 79¹- Cf. ll. 672, 673.

792. 793 =670‚ 671, where see nn.

794. ante: i.e. in ll. 783-786.

795. commutatum:commutationem: no ease of any noun in
-dtio could be used by Lucr. in his verse: it was fortunate that the
a in ratio is short.

796. conuertier: see n. tol. ²07·

797 =673·

798. qu‘m...constituas, ‘why should you not suppose...': the
verb is here followed by acc. and inf.: for a different constr., cf.
1. 743-

tan natura praedita = immutabilia.

800. eadem=also.

801. ordine is their position in relation to one another.

motu: we learn in Book ii that all atoms, whether free in space
01· temporarily combining to make a res, never cease to move at an
enormous speed. This movement is of great importance in deter-
mining the qualities of any res.

802. sic=et sic.

803-829. lt is true that growing plants need each of tlte four
elements in some form, just as a man, if deprived of lzis appropriate
foed, would waste away and die. ln botlz cases, tlte explanation is
tlte same: there are atoms common to thefood and the tlzz‘ngfld‚ and
these are absorbed by tlze latter. Even {f many atoms in any two
res are tlze same, yet their arrangement and motion have great
influente to determine the result produced by theit- union. T lte relation
qs letters to words z'llustrates the relation os atoms to res.

The imaginary objector implies that, because the four elements
are necessary to plants, therefore the plants are identical with the
four elements. Lucr. admits the argument, but denies the conclusion.
He says in effect: ⁴ Let us examine the facts of nutrition generally.
As plants need rain and sun, air and earth, to seed them, so animals
seed on plants. This is possible, because there are atoms common
to the rain and the plant. and also atoms common to the plant and
the animal. In each ease the common atoms are absorbed as food3
