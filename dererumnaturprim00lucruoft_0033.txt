INTRODUCTION xxv

Bernays in lecture without lifting his cap; and Bernays
was indeed no ordinary scholar. To great learning, never
a rarity in Germany, he added an acuteness of mind, a
catholicity of interest, and a sense os form, which are
rare in any country. He had no racial or religious ex—
clusiveness: though a devout Jew, he did not hate
Christians; though a German, he did not despise English
scholarship. Most of his books are short: they deal in
about a hundred pages with some problem of history or
philosophy 2 and it is hard to say whether the matter or
the form of these little masterpieces is more admirable.

His first publication, in 1847, dealt with the text of
Lueretiusl. Five years later his text of the whole poem
was published by Teubner. In 1853 he was working at
a commentary on Lucretius, intended for the Clarendon
Press; and even that great institution might have been
proud to publish it. But not a single sheet of it ever
reached Oxford: he laid it aside‚ and the remonstrances
of his friends could never persuade him to complete it.
What he had prepared for print was first published in
18852‚ four years after his death; and it ends at l. 685 of
the First Book. Everything intended for print Bernays
wrote out at least three times with his own hand; and
the perfectiori of form that marks this fragment is the
reward of such pains. Every word tells. The Latin notes
are generally very brief, though there are plenty of them.
But at times he quotes a long text of Epicurus, emends
it perhaps, translates it into perspicuous Latin, and ex-
plains it. Every lover of Lucretius must regard it as a
real misfortune that Bernays never completed this com-
mentary.

CARLo Gmssmu was born at Milan in 1840 and studied
in Germany, giving his attention chiefly to Oriental
Languages. In 1876 he was appointed Professor of Latin
