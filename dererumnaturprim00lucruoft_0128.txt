94 DE RERVM NATVRA, LIBER PRIMVS

565. huo accedit, uti=secondly.

566. cum constant, ‘while the atoms are...': for this archaic
constr„ cs. l. 726: Cicero would write cum constent: and Lucr.
himself has subj. in l. 519.

reddi=expediri, ‘to be explained,' ‘accounted for': cf. ii 178
ausim Ι confirmare aliisque ex rebus reddere multz's. Epicurus used
ἀποδοθῆναι in this sense.

567. fiunt, ‘are formed.'

uapores, lit. ‘heats‚’=12grm·s. These are the four elements out of
which Empedocles held that matter was formed. Lucr. here says in
effect to Empedocles: ‘With my atoms and void I can account for
your four elements; with your four elements you cannot account for
such substances as stone and iron.’

568. quaeque, ‘each of them.’

571. unde, ‘out of what.'

572. non pot-,erit ratio reddi, ¹ an explanation cannot be given’:
cf. reddi above.

funditus goes with carebit, omnis with natura, ‘their whole
nature’ (Munro); but perhaps ‘all nature' is better.

573. principto fundamenti, ‘a starting-point of solidity’= cf.
l. 339 prz'nczpium cedendi.

574. sunt: sc. primordia.

576. artari, ‘be closely massed’: cf. arte l. 610.

577-583. (f it be granted thal atoms are divisihle, still we can only
explain tlte actual existence of matter by means ff indeslructible
parlz'cles qf some kind. But it is impossible to believe that any panida,
ts divisible, could desjt tlte destmctive power qf infin ite time.

This third argument begins with words almost identical with those
used in 1. 551. The arguments are closely related. Hence Giussani
places ll. 577-583 aster 1. 564. The reasons for transposition are
strong; but so much here is uncertain that I leave the lines where
they stand.

577. el has the sense of etsi: ‘even if’ we grant the infinite
divisibility of matter.
578. quaeque...corpora=cuiqne rei sua corpora.

579. superare has the sense of superesset cs. l. 790.
corpora, ‘material particles.’
580 lueant=sint.
