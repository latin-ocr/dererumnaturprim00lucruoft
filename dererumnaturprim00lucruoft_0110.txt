76 DE RERVM NATVRA‚ LIBER PRIMVS

34²· ante oculos, ‘plainly': cf. l. 62.

In all these arguments, Lucr. follows strictly the method of
Epicurus: in each an appeal to the senses (eg. oculi) is followed by
reasoning (ratio) based on that appeal: cf. l. 42 5.

343. sollicsto, ‘restless.’

priuata adds nothing to the meaning os carerent.

344. A new point is now made: is there were no void, not only
would motion be impossible, but the atoms could never have com-
bined to form created things (res) at all.

345. materies = primordia.

346. praeterea=secondly. Lucr. next proves the existence of
void in created things.

quamuis solidae, ‘however free from void’: the opposite of
solidus in this sense is rarus. Every res (created thing) without
exception is rara.

347. hinc, ‘from what follows.’

349. ltquidus and liquidus are found in the same 1. of Lucr.‚ iv
¹259 liquidis et liquida crassis: other poets shorten the first i.

omnia, ‘all the place’: common both in prose and poetry.

This vivid description is very characteristic and certainly cannot
be derived srom Epicurus.

350. omne, ‘every part os.' Yet the body of an animal appears to
be a solid thing.

35²· cibus: trees seed. on rain which they draw in by their roots
and convert into sap.

totas: Lucr. wrote arbusta above, because the metre obliged
him (see n. to l. 187); but he ineant arbores, which suits his
argument much better: and, to let the reader know this, he now
writes totas, as if arbores had preceded. This is not a solecism buta
deliberate artifice. No similar instance occurs in the poem.

3 54„ saepta, ‘walls': cf. iv 699 saxea saepta.

<nausa domorum, ‘shut houses‚' i.e. the doors of houses.

355. rig-idum, ‘stiffeniug’; or perhaps ‘chill.’

356. quod, ‘a thing which....’

nisi sint, ...uideresz an irregular condition osten used in verse
for metrical reasons: the irregularity appears to be confined to the

protasis: cf. Tib. i 4, 63 carmina m' sint, l ex umero Pelopis non
nituisset ebur.
