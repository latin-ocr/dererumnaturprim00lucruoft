48 DE RERVM NATVRA‚ LIBER PRIMVS

perempta: in prose Lucr. would have written peremptas and so
avoided the ambiguity ι sor the sake of metre, he now continues as
if he had written omnia in 1. 56 and not omnis res.

58-61 is a mere note, in which Lucr. tells the reader that he
must recognise ‘atoms ’ under the disguise of different names which
they will bear in the course of the poem. This variety of names is
mainly due to the requirements of metre.

How should these aliases be translated? Munro has asdifferent
equivalent for each : e.g. ‘ matter ’ for materies. In order to keep the
argument clear, it is perhaps better to translate materies etc. by
‘atoms‚’ wherever this is the actual meaning: cf. 11. 171, ²45·

58. nos, ‘ Ι ⁹: he refers solely to his own practice.

materiem, ὕλην, ‘ matter’ z (of course ‘atonis ⁵ is inadmissible
here).

genitalia corpora. rebus, ‘bodies (i.e. material particles) which
produce created things': the phrasezcmpora quae genitalia rebus
sunt. But the dat. is odd; and it is hard to see why Lucr. did not
write rerum instead.

59. reddunda. in ratione, ‘in philosophical discussion ' : a techni-
cal term in Lucr. ε cf. ii 987 doctis rationem reddere dz'clz's.

uocare, appellare, usurpare: Lucr. seems to imply that he can
find at need synonyms sor other things as well as atoms ε sor another
series of synonymS‚ cf. 1. 298 foll. There is a well-marked vein of
humour in the poem.

semina, σπέρματα, ‘ seeds.’

60. usurpare, ⁴ to term ' z lit. ⁴ to handle,’ uoce being understood:
cf. usurpare oculis (l. 301): cf. Cic. Off ii 40 Laelius qui Sapiens
usurpatur.

61. corpora prima, ⁴ first bodies‚' i.e. primary particles of matter.

sunt, ‘ are sormed.'

omnia=res omnes, ‘ all created things.’

primis, ‘ as primary particles.'

Five names for atoms have now been given : there is a sixth‚ often
used though not mentioned here, elementa εστοιχεῖας and aseventh‚
corpuscula.
