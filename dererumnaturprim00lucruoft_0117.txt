NOTES 83

425. confirmare, ‘to prove.’

animi ratione = λογισμῷ os Epicurus: the mind can exercise reason
upon the evidence supplied by the senses.

4²8· esse: sor the emphatic position, see n. to 1. 24.

neque—meare, ‘nor to travel at all in any direction‚ this way or
that)

4²9· ante: the reference is to 11. 378 soll.. where the movement
os bodies was discussed: meare here :procedere et concedere there.

(So Munro; but Giussani, perhaps rightly, supposes that the refer-
ence is to ll. 335 foll.)

430. praeterea :praeter inane et corpora (l. 445).

43¹· esse, ‘exists,' is made emphatic by position. Lucr. explains
here more sully what he means by per se esse.

43²- ‘To count, so to say, as the discovery osa third substance.‘

numero adds nothing to the sense.

natura here=‘primal essence’ : so in l. 446.

433. The meaning is: we shall not include in the list of things
that exist anything that does not exist per se. ipsum :per se.

The argument that follows takes the form osa dilemma.

434. cui sl tactus erit, ‘but if it admit os touch‚’ i.e. of touching
and being touched: cf. l. 304.

435, 436. ‘'fhen, provided it exist, it will, by a large or at any
rate a small addition, increase the amount of body and be included
in the aggregate’ of body.

The transposition is necessary: the attempt to keep the MS. order
ot the lines, with the reading aliquo, sails; because void cannot have
augmen (bulk).

437. tntaetue=dva4262 ‘ incapable os touching or being touched 't
the word is not used again by Lucr.

440- praeterea, ‘secondly': quite unlike praeterea os l. 430.

This argument takes the form ofa trilemnia.

441. ame...agentibus: abl. absol„ :dum aliae res agunt, ‘other
things being the agentS.’

fungtzwdoxetv, ‘to be acted upon’: often used by Lucr. as the
passive ofsacere=rrozcim ‘to act.'

44²· possint: Munro keeps possunt of MSS.‚ comparing ila ut
debent of ii 901: but the presence here of in eo surely sorbids this
explanation.
